 EDWARDS , Circuit Judge.
This is a complaint alleging violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
It is brought on behalf of two pregnant school teachers in the Cleveland school system under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. 1983 (1970).
Each has been placed on "maternity leave" involuntarily and seeks reinstatement with back pay and injunctive relief against the implementation of the school board's maternity leave policy.
Each claims that the school board's rule is an unconstitutional discrimination on grounds of sex.
The rule appellants attack has the effect of requiring a pregnant teacher to take unpaid leave of absence from her school duties five months before the expected birth of a child and to continue on such status thereafter until the beginning of the first school term following the date when the baby becomes three months old.
The school board rule under attack provides as follows: five (5) months before the expected date two (2) weeks before the effective date of the leave of absence [**6] two (2) years beginning of the three (3) months Written A teacher's failure to follow the above rules for maternity leave of absence shall be construed as termination of contract or as grounds for dismissal The District Judge who heard this case took extensive testimony, made findings of fact and concluded that the Cleveland Board of Education's rule did not discriminate against women and was not so unreasonable or arbitrary as to be unconstitutional.
The basic rationale for the District Judge's holding is set forth as follows: [**7] LaFleur v. Cleveland Board of Education 326 F.Supp.
1208, 1211 Appellants' contentions are that the rule is arbitrary and unreasonable in its overbreadth and that it is a discriminatory rule applicable to only one sex, in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
It is relevant for us to note two developments which have occurred since this case was argued.
First, in a split decision a panel of the Fifth Circuit held a distinctly less onerous maternity leave rule of the Texas Employment Commission not to be arbitrary and unreasonable in a constitutional sense.
Schattman v. Texas Employment Commission , 459 F.2d 32 (5th Cir. 1972).
(Decided March 1, 1972, order amending Judge Wisdom's Opinion dated March 17, 1972.)
Second, Congress has now amended Title VII of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act to make it applicable to public schools.
42 U.S.C. 2000e(a) , P.L.
92-261, 86 Stat. 103 (1972).
The EEOC has also adopted a rule prohibiting special maternity leave disability rules as discriminatory on grounds of sex.
29 C.F.R. 1604.10(b) , 37 Fed.Reg.
6837 (April 5, 1972).
While clearly neither of these last decisions controls our present case, they do tend to lessen the reach of our holding.
The Cleveland Board of Education maternity leave [**8] rule was adopted in 1952.
It is considerably more severe in its effect upon employment of pregnant teachers than the Texas Employment Commission rule dealt with in the Schattman case, or any other similar rule which has been called to our attention.
Depending on the period of the year when the birth of the child was expected, the effect of the rule would be to put any pregnant teacher on involuntary leave for a period ranging from six months to over a year.
The Texas Employment Commission rule required leave to be taken two months before expected birth and an application to return to work could be filed at any time thereafter.
The principal social purpose claimed to be served by the Cleveland Board of Education rule is continuity of classroom instruction and relief of burdensome administrative problems.
Yet any actual disability imposed on any teacher, male or female, poses the same administrative problems and many (including flu and the common cold) can't be anticipated or planned for at all.
This rule may arguably make some administrative burdens lighter.
But these are not the only values concerned.
The Supreme Court reminds us: [**9] Stanley v. Illinois 405 U.S. 645 92 S.Ct. 1208 31 L.Ed.2d 551 The three month enforced unemployment after birth has no relation to the employer's interest at all.
While having a mother with her infant for a period after birth may arguably be a question of general state concern, Ohio has not thus far expressed it in any general and nondiscriminatory statute.
Appellees also urge consideration of a view expressed by the author of this rule when in 1952 he suggested its adoption.
Dr. Schinnerer testified that he thought that absent the rule, pregnant teachers would be subjected to "pointing, giggling and .
.
.
snide remarks" by the students.
Basic rights such as those involved in the employment relationship and other citizenship responsibilities cannot be made to yield to embarrassment.
See Abbott v. Mines , 411 F.2d 353 (6th Cir. 1969).
Additionally, at the present time pregnant students are allowed to continue in the Cleveland schools without any apparent ill effects upon the educational system.
If there is substantial support for the Cleveland Board of Education rule to be found in this record, it must be in the testimony of the Board's witness Dr.
William C. Wier, who discussed the problems of pregnancy with obvious concern.
But Dr. Wier also testified that "each pregnancy is an individual matter."
And his cross-examination concluded as follows: [**10] Under no construction of this record can we conclude that the medical evidence presented supports the extended periods of mandatory maternity leave required by the rule both before and after birth of the child.
In a case decided after the District Court decision in this case, the United States Supreme Court invalidated a statute of the State of Idaho which specifically preferred male relatives over female relatives as administrators of estates.
The Court's opinion commented: 15-314 [**11] Reed v. Reed 404 U.S. 71, 76-77 92 S.Ct. 251, 254 30 L.Ed.2d 225 Here, too, we deal with a rule which is inherently based upon a classification by sex.
Male teachers are not subject to pregnancy, but they are subject to many types of illnesses and disabilities.
This record indicates clearly that pregnant women teachers have been singled out for unconstitutionally unequal restrictions upon their employment.
Additionally, as we have observed, the rule is clearly arbitrary and unreasonable in its overbreadth.
As the Supreme Court said in Wieman v. Updegraff , 344 U.S. 183 , 73 S.Ct. 215 , 97 L.Ed. 216 (1952): Id. at 192 73 S.Ct. at 219 We believe that the Fifth Circuit's decision in Schattman v. Texas Employment Commission , supra , is easily distinguishable on the facts and that the same is true in relation to Struck v. Secretary of Defense , 460 F.2d 1372 (9th Cir. 1971), which dealt with pregnancy of a female officer in a war zone.
On the other hand, there is a marked trend of cases to invalidate regulations based on sex classifications unless supported by a valid state interest.
Reed v. Reed , supra ; Sail'er Inn v. Kirby , 5 Cal.3d 1 , 95 Cal.Rptr.
329 , 485 P.2d 529 (1971); Cohen v. Chesterfield County School Board , 326 F.Supp.
1159 (E.D.Va.1971); Seidenberg v. McSorleys' Old Ale House, Inc. , 317 F.Supp.
593 (S.D.N.Y.1970); Kirstein v. Rector and Visitors of University of Virginia , 309 F.Supp.
184 (E.D.Va.1970); Heath v. Westerville Board of Education, et al.
, 345 F.Supp.
501 (S.D. Ohio 1972).
We do not, of course, by our holding concerning this rule deal with reasonable employer requirements of notice of impending disability or of health examinations or certificates.
Such issues are not presented by this appeal.
The judgment of the District Court is vacated and reversed [**12] and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
