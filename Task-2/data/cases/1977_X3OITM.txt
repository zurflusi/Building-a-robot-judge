 HUFSTEDLER , Circuit Judge: This appeal presents the question whether there is a diversity jurisdiction analog in the District Court of Guam over causes of action which the Guam legislature has otherwise lodged in the Guam Island Court.
1 Plaintiff Eleanor Mailloux, a citizen of West Virginia, brought this action to enforce a marital settlement agreement against her former husband, a citizen and resident of Guam, and joined the Chase Manhattan Bank as a codefendant because it had received the proceeds from the sale of the property in dispute.
The action was brought in the Guam District Court which decided that it had jurisdiction under section 1424(a) of the Organic Act of Guam ( 48 U.S.C. 1424(a) ), in light of 28 U.S.C. 1332(d) .
Congress did not specifically address the question whether federal diversity jurisdiction would exist after the Guamanian legislature transferred local causes of action to the Island Court.
Both the Organic Act and the 1958 revision of its judiciary section are silent on the point.
We reach the conclusion that Congress intended that the Guam District Court have diversity jurisdiction analogous to that of a federal district court within the States, because a major purpose of the Organic Act was to bring to Guam a judiciary closely analogous to that of the United States and, particularly, to grant to the citizens of Guam the benefits of the privileges and immunities clauses of the Federal Constitution, which include access to federal courts in diversity cases as long as diversity jurisdiction is a federal jurisdictional component.
The Organic Act grants the District Court of Guam "jurisdiction of a district court of the United States in all causes arising under the Constitution, treaties, and laws of the United States, regardless of the sum or value of the matter in controversy .
. "
The words "arising under the .
.
.
laws of the United States" are not automatically selfdefining, and they have meant different things in different contexts.

the laws of the United States"); P. Bator, D. Shapiro, P. Mishkin, and H. Wechsler, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 850-73 (1973).)
We read the "arising under .
.
."
language in the Organic Act in conjunction with the more recent enactment of section 1421b(u) , extending the privileges and immunities clauses of the Federal Constitution to Guam, to help us solve the diversity riddle.
2 The extension to Guamanian citizens of the privileges and immunities of national citizenship 3 was intended to "guarantee to all U.S. citizens in or entering Guam--including corporations of any of the United States--rights of national citizenship such as .
.
.
the right to appeal in proper cases to the national courts, and the right of protection abroad."
4 The privileges of national citizenship 5 have been construed to include the right of access to federal courts via diversity jurisdiction.
( Terral v. Burke Construction Co. (1922) 257 U.S. 529 , 42 S.Ct. 188 , 66 L.Ed. 352 (nonresident corporations have right to resort to federal courts under diversity and removal statutes which is of constitutional proportion; state cannot condition license on waiver of that right); Garrity v. New Jersey (1967) 385 U.S. 493, 500 , 87 S.Ct. 616, 620 , 17 L.Ed.2d 562 ("There are rights of constitutional stature whose exercise a State may not condition by the exaction of a price.
.
.
.
Resort to the federal courts in diversity of citizenship cases is another.

"); Pennsylvania v. Local 542, Operating Engineers (E.D.Pa.1972) 347 F.Supp.
268, 297 .)
Congress intended that Guam should be treated as if it were a state for the purpose of applying the privileges and immunities clauses.
6 That purpose is fulfilled by reading section 1424(a) together with section 1421b(u) to provide the Guam District Court with diversity jurisdiction, thus giving Guamanian litigants access to the federal courts analogous to that guaranteed to litigants within the States by the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
This interpretation of sections 1424(a) and 1421b(u) also implements the broad policies of the Organic Act of Guam which included providing Guam with a judiciary closely patterned on that of the United States.

Olsen (1976) 540 F.2d 1011, 1012 , cert. granted , 429 U.S. 959 , 97 S.Ct. 380 , 50 L.Ed.2d 325 ) (language should be construed in context of, and with reference to, the whole territorial structure established for Guam by Congress).)
AFFIRMED.
