 WRIGHT , Circuit Judge.
The Foreign Agents Registration Act 1 provides criminal penalties 2 against anyone who represents a foreign government in this country and fails to register with the Attorney General.
Certain exceptions are provided.
3 Appellees are attorneys at law representing the Republic of Cuba who have been requested by the Attorney General to register pursuant to the Act.
Instead of registering, appellees filed this declaratory judgment action, alleging that since their representation of Cuba is limited to "legal matters, including litigation, involving the mercantile and financial interests of the Republic of Cuba," they are exempt from registering under Section 3(d) 4 of the Act.
They pray for a judgment so declaring.
In effect, therefore, this proceeding is an effort to restrain the Attorney General from prosecuting appellees under the Act.
The District Court denied appellant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and certified this action for appeal.
5 The threshold question is presented by the venerable, but creaking, doctrine of sovereign immunity.
There is no suggestion that the United States has consented to this suit or that the Attorney General is being sued as an individual.
Indeed, the named defendant is "The Attorney General of the United States," the name of the current office holder not being included.
6 Consequently, the action, if maintainable at all, must fit the fiction created by Ex parte Young , 209 U.S. 123 , 28 S.Ct. 441 , 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908).
There it was held that where an officer acts unconstitutionally, "he is in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct."
209 U.S. at 160 , 28 S.Ct. at 454 , 52 L.Ed. 714 .
Since in such circumstances the officer is theoretically being sued as an individual, the doctrine of sovereign immunity provides no bar.
Thus a fiction is indulged to circumvent sovereign immunity.
Ex parte Young , supra , has spawned a welter of cases, all seeking to get under its umbrella.
7 The confusion which ensued has been to some extent relieved by the holding in Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Corp. , 337 U.S. 682 , 69 S.Ct. 1457 , 93 L.Ed. 1628 , (1949), reiterated in Malone v. Bowdoin , 369 U.S. 643 , 82 S.Ct. 980 , 8 L.Ed.2d 168 (1962), that an officer of the United States may indeed be sued in his individual capacity where the officer's action is "not within the officer's statutory powers or, if within those powers, only if the powers, or their exercise in the particular case, are constitutionally void."
337 U.S. at 702 , 69 S.Ct. at 1467 , 93 L.Ed. 1628 and 369 U.S. at 647 , 82 S.Ct. at 983 , 8 L.Ed.2d 168 .
It is not alleged in the complaint that prosecution of the appellees under the Act would be unconstitutional 8 or outside the Attorney General's [**212] statutory powers.
9 Appellees' primary argument on the unconsented suit point seems to be that "the doctrine that a suit against a government officer in his official capacity may be a suit against the United States applies only in the situation where the suit is either for government funds or for specific property in the possession of the government."
We are not aware that the doctrine of sovereign immunity is so circumscribed.
If "[t]he 'essential nature and effect of the proceeding' may be such as to make plain that the judgment sought would interfere with the public administration," the suit is one against the sovereign.
Land v. Dollar , 330 U.S. 731, 738 , 67 S.Ct. 1009, 1012 , 91 L.Ed. 1209 (1947), citing Ex Parte State of New York, No. 1 , 256 U.S. 490, 500, 502 , 41 S.Ct. 588 , 65 L.Ed. 1057 (1921).
10 Obviously, restraining the Attorney General from enforcing the criminal laws of the United States would "interfere with the public administration."
Appellees rely heavily on Professor Borchard in arguing that civil procedure should be substituted for criminal procedure in the area not involving moral turpitude, particularly "where there is grave uncertainty as to what practices the general terms of a law prohibit."
Borchard, Declaratory Judgments (2d Ed. 1941), p. 1021.
They also assert with Professor Borchard "that one of the main and most beneficial functions of declaratory judgment procedure is as a substitute for criminal prosecutions in the area of regulation of business practices."
Philosophically, we may agree.
But the Congress has decreed otherwise, at least so far as agents representing foreign governments are concerned.
Consequently, since appellees have failed to challenge the constitutionality of the Act, on its face or as applied, or the authority of the Attorney General to enforce it, this case should be dismissed on the pleadings as an unconsented suit against the United States.
So ordered.
