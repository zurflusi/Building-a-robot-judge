 HAMLIN , Circuit Judge.
Mario DiBella, appellant, appeals from an order of the District Court denying his motion to suppress certain evidentiary items seized in his apartment by agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics on March 9, 1959, at the time of his arrest.
The motion was made after arrest and arraignment of appellant but before his indictment.
On November 30, 1959, subsequent to his indictment, the motion was denied by the District Court, with leave to renew it at the time of trial.
On December 3, 1959, appellant gave notice of appeal to this Court from the order of the District Court.
There has as yet been no trial of appellant.
Initially, the United States, appellee, raises the question as to whether such an order is appealable.
Over a period of many years this Court has consistently held that where the application is made prior to indictment, as it was in this case, that a defendant may appeal to this Court from an order denying his motion to suppress.
United States v. Poller , 2 Cir., 1930, 43 F.2d 911 , 74 A.L.R. 1382; Cheng Wai v. United States , 2 Cir., 1942, 125 F.2d 915 ; cf. United States v. Klapholz , 2 Cir., 1956, 230 F.2d 494 ; United States v. Russo , 2 Cir., 1957, 241 F.2d 285 .
We hold the order made by the District Court in this case to be appealable.
The motion was argued before the District Court by counsel on either side and affidavits and counteraffidavits were presented for his consideration.
From the showing there made, the following factual situation appeared.
On October 15, 1958, one David W. Costa, a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, presented to United States Commissioner Epstein in the Eastern District of New York a complaint praying for the arrest of appellant.
This complaint stated: Upon the basis of this complaint Commissioner Epstein issued a warrant of arrest.
On March 9, 1959, the narcotic agents saw appellant sitting in his living room in his apartment.
At 8:15 p. m. Agent Costa, with the warrant of arrest in his possession, went with other agents to appellant's apartment.
It was nighttime.
The agents rang the bell and the door was opened by appellant's stepdaughter.
The agents identified themselves, showed her their credentials, and walked into the living room, where they identified themselves to appellant, showed him a copy of the arrest warrant, and placed him under arrest.
A quantity of narcotics was found, which, together with other items, the agents seized.
1 In Application of Fried , D.C., 68 F.Supp.
961, 964 , consideration was given to the sufficiency of a complaint upon which a warrant of arrest was issued.
There, the complaint, after alleging that the defendants had in their possession certain goods and chattels knowing the same to have been stolen, contained the following statement: The Court there held "Such a complaint will not support a warrant of arrest.
United States v. McCunn , D.C.S.D.N.Y., 1930, 40 F.2d 295 ; United States ex rel.
King v. Gokey , D.C.N.D.N.Y., 1929, 32 F.2d 793 ; United States v. Pollack , D.C.N.J., 1946, 64 F.Supp.
554 ; United States v. Ruroede , D.C.S.D.N.Y., 220 F. 210 ."
Recently the question of the sufficiency of a complaint to justify a warrant of arrest was considered in Giordenello v. United States , 357 U.S. 480 , 78 S.Ct. 1245, 1247 , 2 L.Ed.2d 1503 .
The complaint in that case read as follows: In striking down the complaint as insufficient in that case, the Court said: The Court further said: We hold that the complaint upon which the warrant of arrest was based was deficient in this case, and would not support the warrant of arrest which was issued under it.
It is particularly deficient in setting forth the sources of his information or grounds for his belief.
True, it recites that his belief an offense had been committed was grounded on his "personal observations in this case, the statements of Samuel Panzarella, and other witnesses in this case, and the reports and records of the Bureau of Narcotics," but what other sources could there possibly be?
Such a shotgun, all-encompassing enumeration is no better than none at all.
There is no indication of what he had personally observed, what he had heard from others or what he learned from the reports and records of the Bureau of Narcotics.
Neither is there presented the basis for crediting the hearsay of the nameless "other witnesses" or the unidentified "reports and records."
The complaint is no better than that in Giordenello v. United States, and the warrant is invalid for the same reasons.
Appellee, however, contended in the court below (as it contends here) that regardless of any objection of appellant that the warrant of arrest was improperly issued, that Agent Costa had probable cause to effect a valid arrest of appellant under the authority of 26 U.S.C. 7607 , which states that, among others, agents of the Bureau of Narcotics may: section 4731 section 4761 The District Court, in its opinion agreeing with the position of appellee, stated [ 178 F.Supp.
7 ]: "However, quite apart from the question of the propriety of the issuance of the warrant, Agent Costa had grounds for believing that DiBella had committed a violation of the Narcotics Acts sufficiently reasonable to justify his arrest without a warrant."
To properly evaluate this contention, we shall examine some of the further facts that were presented upon the hearing to the District Judge.
It appears that on October 6, 1958, Agent Costa and another agent, one Daniel D. Moynihan, in an endeavor to obtain a search warrant each signed and presented to United States Commissioner Abruzzo an affidavit which set forth the knowledge each agent had from personal observation and from information received, concerning the activities of appellant in connection with possession and sale of narcotics.
These affidavits set forth in detail certain events occurring on August 26, 1958, and on September 10, 1958, from which it could be inferred that there was a sale of narcotics on each of those two occasions by appellant to the narcotics agents through one Panzarella.
These affidavits are set out in full in a footnote.
2 A search warrant was not issued by United States Commissioner Abruzzo, to whom the affidavits were presented, but the affidavits were presented to the District Judge for his consideration on the instant motion to suppress.
In Draper v. United States , 358 U.S. 307 , at page 310, 79 S.Ct. 329 , at pages 331, 332, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 , it was held that where a narcotic agent had "probable cause" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and "reasonable grounds" within the meaning of the Narcotic Control Act to believe that a person had committed or was committing a violation of the narcotics laws, he could make a lawful arrest.
The Court there said, quoting Brinegar v. United States , 338 U.S. 160, 172-173 , 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1309 , 93 L.Ed. 1879 : quanta At page 313 of 358 U.S. , at page 333 of 79 S.Ct. , the Court said: Brinegar v. United States supra 338 U.S. at [page] 175 69 S.Ct. at page 1310 Carroll v. United States 267 U.S. 132, 162 45 S.Ct. 280, 288 69 L.Ed. 543 In the present case, Costa had not only the benefit of his own observations of the contacts and activities of appellant and Panzarella, but he also had the benefit of the information given him by Agent Moynihan as to the sales of heroin by Panzarella to Moynihan.
An examination of the affidavits of Agents Moynihan and Costa shows that both on August 26, 1958, and on September 10, 1958, appellant and Panzarella were under the surveillance of each agent.
On August 26, for instance, Panzarella agreed to sell Moynihan heroin, and stated that he had to contact his connection.
He made a telephone call and then went with Agent Moynihan to 79th Street near Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights.
Moynihan saw Panzarella leave his vehicle, walk to 79th Street and 37th Avenue, and enter a green Chrysler automobile with New York license No. 6971NE.
Moynihan saw Panzarella leave the Chrysler a few minutes later at 79th Street and Roosevelt Avenue, and saw Panzarella return to his vehicle, upon which Panzarella handed to Moynihan the envelope which proved to contain heroin.
At the same time, Costa saw appellant enter the same Chrysler automobile and saw him drive to 37th Avenue and 79th Street, saw him meet Panzarella who then entered the Chrysler automobile.
He saw the two men drive to 79th Street and Roosevelt Avenue and saw Panzarella leave the automobile.
Costa then saw Panzarella walk to 78th Street and meet Agent Moynihan and hand a small envelope to him.
The later tests showed that this envelope contained heroin.
Likewise, on September 10, 1958, each agent saw approximately the same procedure followed between Panzarella and appellant.
On the latter occasion, Panzarella, after being in contact with appellant, came back to Moynihan and sold him an ounce of heroin which he told Moynihan he obtained from DiBella.
Appellant was seen meeting Panzarella, be with him briefly, and Panzarella was seen to immediately return to Moynihan with the heroin.
Taking all of the circumstances together, we believe that there was ample evidence to hold that Costa had "reasonable grounds to believe" that appellant had committed a violation of the narcotics laws.
With all the information Costa had, both from his own observation and from information received from Moynihan, Costa would have indeed been naive if he did not believe that appellant had just provided the narcotics which Panzarella delivered to Moynihan.
Although Costa's affidavit was based in part on hearsay, there was "a substantial basis for crediting" the information given him by a fellow-agent, information which was wholly consistent with what Costa himself had observed.
Jones v. United States , 362 U.S. 257, 269 , 80 S.Ct. 725, 735 , 4 L.Ed.2d 697 .
We hold that at any time after September 10, 1958, Costa had reasonable grounds to believe that DiBella had committed a violation of the narcotics laws.
Appellant contends, however, that the delay from September, 1958, until March, 1959, when the arrest was made, was sufficient to say that in March, 1959, Costa did not have reasonable grounds to believe that DiBella had committed a narcotics violation.
We cannot so hold.
An explanation was given by appellee that the delay was occasioned by a desire on the part of the agents to uncover further violations.
Be that as it may, we do not believe that the delay eradicated from Costa's mind the knowledge that he had received by September, 1958, of appellant's apparent violations of the narcotics laws.
When appellant was arrested on March 9, 1959, Costa had in his possession the warrant of arrest which had been issued October 15, 1958, and after arresting appellant under color of this warrant, which we have held to have been invalidly issued, made a return on it showing that he had executed the warrant by arresting DiBella on the 9th day of March, 1959.
We do not believe that this helps appellant.
Although Costa apparently believed that this warrant was a valid one, yet, even though it was not, the arrest may be justified on the ground that Costa had reasonable grounds to believe that DiBella had committed a narcotics violation.
In Williams v. United States , 9 Cir., 273 F.2d 781 , the arrest was made upon a warrant of arrest which the Court held to be invalid.
However, the arrest was justified on the basis of the arresting officer having reasonable grounds to believe a violation had been committed.
In Giordenello v. United States , supra , the Supreme Court held that the warrant of arrest was invalid.
The case points out, however, that in the Supreme Court, for the first time, the Government contended that the arrest could be justified without a warrant on the basis that there was probable cause to believe that the person arrested had committed a felony.
The Supreme Court held that these contentions by the Government, having been made for the first time before that Court, were belated, and refused to consider them.
The case was reversed, but the Supreme Court stated: 357 U.S. at page 488 78 S.Ct. at page 1251 The arrest of DiBella by Costa, who, on March 9, 1959, had reasonable grounds to believe DiBella had committed a violation of the narcotics law, was a lawful arrest.
The arrest being lawful, a reasonable search of appellant's premises, such as shown in this case, was proper.
United States v. Rabinowitz , 339 U.S. 56 , 70 S.Ct. 430 , 94 L.Ed. 653 .
Judgment affirmed.
