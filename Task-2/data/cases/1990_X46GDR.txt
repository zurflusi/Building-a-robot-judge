 RIPPLE , Circuit Judge.
Jeanne Farrey, formerly known as Jeanne Sanderfoot, appeals from the district court's order reversing the bankruptcy court's determination that Gerald Sanderfoot could not avoid, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 522(f) , a lien held by Ms. Farrey on Mr. Sanderfoot's homestead property.
Because we agree with the district court that the lien is avoidable, we affirm.
I BACKGROUND A. Facts Jeanne and Gerald Sanderfoot were married on August 12, 1966.
The Wisconsin Circuit Court for Outagamie County granted a judgment of divorce and property division on September 12, 1986, and entered a written judgment of divorce on February 5, 1987.
The court awarded Ms. Farrey half the refund and/or liability with respect to the couple's 1985 income taxes, certain personal property, and half the proceeds of items ordered sold at auction.
The marital home, valued by the court at $104,000.00, and all remaining personal property were awarded to Mr. Sanderfoot.
1 After all assets and debts were assigned to the parties, Ms. Farrey was left with a net estate of $1,091.90, while Mr. Sanderfoot had a net estate of $59,508.79.
To achieve a more appropriate distribution, the court ordered Mr. Sanderfoot to pay Ms. Farrey $29,208.44.
Mr. Sanderfoot was to pay half that amount ($14,604.22) on or before January 10, 1987; the remaining portion was due on or before April 10, 1987.
To secure this debt, the court awarded Ms. Farrey a lien against the home to remain attached until the debt was paid in full.
2 Mr. Sanderfoot has not yet paid any part of the debt.
Accordingly, Ms. Farrey has not relinquished her record title interest in the property.
Mr. Sanderfoot voluntarily filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on May 4, 1987, and listed the residential home on his schedule of assets.
He identified the real estate as his homestead and claimed it was exempt property pursuant to Wis.Stat.
815.20 .
3 B. The Bankruptcy Court Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 522(f)(1) , 4 Mr. Sanderfoot moved to avoid the lien against his property.
Ms. Farrey filed her objection to the motion, claiming section 522(f)(1) could not operate to divest her of her interest in the marital home.
5 The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin denied Mr. Sanderfoot's motion on March 9, 1988.
The bankruptcy court applied the reasoning of In re Boyd , 741 F.2d 1112, 1114-15 (8th Cir.1984), which held that a lien created by a divorce decree protects the non-debtor spouse's preexisting interest in the marital home and thus does not attach to the debtor's interest.
In this case, the court determined that Mr. Sanderfoot acquired his interest in the property by virtue of the divorce decree and took that interest subject to Ms. Farrey's lien.
In re Sanderfoot , 83 B.R. 564, 567-68 (Bankr.E.D.Wis.1988).
Consequently, the court held that, even though the lien impaired Mr. Sanderfoot's exemption, it could not be avoided because it did not attach to his interest in the home.
C. The District Court In determining whether the requirements of section 522(f) had been satisfied, the district court concluded that there was "no dispute that the lien is a judicial lien that impairs Mr. Sanderfoot's homestead exemption."
6 In re Sanderfoot , 92 B.R. 802, 803 (E.D.Wis.1988).
The court rejected the reasoning of Boyd and held that the divorce decree both extinguished all preexisting interests and simultaneously created new interests.
Accordingly, the bankruptcy court's order denying Mr. Sanderfoot's motion to avoid the lien under section 522(f)(1) was reversed.
Ms. Farrey filed a timely notice of appeal on November 3, 1988.
II ANALYSIS A. Standard of review The issue before the court is whether 11 U.S.C. 522(f)(1) allows a bankruptcy debtor to avoid a lien against his homestead where the lien was granted to the debtor's former spouse under a divorce decree.
There are no questions of fact.
The issue is one of law, subject to de novo review.
See Park Terrace Townhouses v. Wilds , 852 F.2d 1019, 1021 (7th Cir.1988); In re Evanston Motor Co., Inc. , 735 F.2d 1029, 1031 (7th Cir.1984).
B. Lien avoidance under 11 U.S.C. 522(f) The inquiry in this case is the proper interpretation of section 522(f)(1) .
Though the issue seems straightforward, courts have had "some difficulty in defining precisely the interest of an ex-spouse arising out of a property settlement made during a divorce proceeding."
In re Donahue , 862 F.2d 259, 262 (10th Cir.1988).
The issue is one of first impression in the Seventh Circuit, though this "difficulty" has led to a split among the courts of appeals that have examined the statute.
Compare In re Borman , 886 F.2d 273 (10th Cir.1989) and Boyd v. Robinson , 741 F.2d 1112 (8th Cir.1984) with In re Pederson , 875 F.2d 781 (9th Cir.1989) and Maus v. Maus , 837 F.2d 935 (10th Cir.1988).
The bankruptcy and district courts that have "wade[d] into waters muddied before [them]" are similarly divided.
In re Rittenhouse , 103 B.R. 250, 252 (D.Kan.1989).
Interpretation of a statute must begin with the statute's plain language.
United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc. , U.S. , 109 S.Ct. 1026, 1030 , 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989); United States v. Rosado , 866 F.2d 967, 969 (7th Cir.), cert. denied , U.S. , 110 S.Ct. 117 , 107 L.Ed.2d 79 (1989).
In this case, the bankruptcy code defines most of the terms relevant to our analysis of the nature of Ms. Farrey's lien.
A "lien" is a "charge against or interest in property to secure payment of a debt or performance of an obligation."
11 U.S.C. 101(33) .
The parties do not contest the conclusion that Ms. Farrey has a lien as that term is defined.
Rather, their disagreement arises from contrary interpretations of the application of section 522(f)(1) , which allows the debtor to avoid liens if three requirements are met: In re Sanderfoot , 92 B.R. at 803 (citing In re Hart , 50 B.R. 956, 960 (Bankr.D.Nev.1985)).
We shall analyze each of these requirements.
1.
Is the lien fixed on an interest of the debtor?
Ms. Farrey first claims that her lien does not attach to Mr. Sanderfoot's interest in his homestead.
The bankruptcy court agreed with this position and found that Mr. Sanderfoot could not avoid the lien because it did not attach to his interest in the property.
83 B.R. at 568-70 .
The district court rejected that argument, as has the only other Wisconsin court that has examined this issue.
See In re Duncan , 85 B.R. 80, 82 (W.D.Wis.1988) (discussed infra ).
The Tenth Circuit noted in Maus v. Maus , 837 F.2d 935, 939 (10th Cir.1988) that "[m]any courts have struggled to find theories under which a lien to enforce a property settlement survives bankruptcy."
The "survival" theory that numerous courts have relied upon, including the bankruptcy court in this case, was first articulated in Boyd v. Robinson , 741 F.2d 1112 (8th Cir.1984).
In Boyd , the debtor commenced a bankruptcy action seeking to avoid her ex-husband's lien, acquired during the parties' divorce proceeding, on their former homestead.
The Eighth Circuit held that liens granted by a divorce decree do not attach to an interest of the debtor, but rather protect a preexisting property right of the non-debtor spouse in the marital home arising under state law during the marriage.
Id. at 1114-15 .
The court determined that applicable Minnesota law recognized the non-debtor spouse's property interest in a homestead acquired during the marriage with marital assets or assets contributed by that spouse.
Id. at 1114 .
Since Boyd , several courts similarly have recognized the non-debtor spouse's preexisting rights in the marital home and refused to let the debtor avoid the lien.
7 Other courts have declined to follow the Eighth Circuit's rationale.
In In re Pederson , 875 F.2d 781 (9th Cir.1989), a split panel of the Ninth Circuit expressly repudiated Boyd and determined that a lien granted in a divorce proceeding to a non-debtor spouse against the debtor's property was subject to avoidance.
The Pederson court rejected the Eighth Circuit's analysis that the debtor's lien attached to a preexisting interest in the property.
In the Ninth Circuit's view, the state court awarded the homestead to the non-debtor spouse before imposing the lien.
Id. at 783 .
The debtor spouse had an interest in the property prior to the order of dissolution, but must Id. (quoting Boyd , 741 F.2d at 1115 (Ross, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original)).
The Tenth Circuit also rejected the reasoning of Boyd in Maus v. Maus , 837 F.2d 935 (10th Cir.1988).
8 There, a settlement agreement incorporated in the divorce judgment awarded the debtor the marital home subject to a lien 9 in favor of the non-debtor spouse.
Because the state court awarded the debtor sole title to the home, "free and clear of any and all claims" of the non-debtor spouse, the lien 10 attached solely to the debtor's interest in the residence.
Id. at 937, 939 .
The court further noted that the "convoluted theory" espoused in Boyd ignored the fact that "the decree gives one party title outright and that is the interest to which the lien attaches."
Id. at 939 .
Several bankruptcy and district courts have followed the rationale in Pederson , 11 but only one other case has focused on the avoidability of a lien created by a Wisconsin divorce court.
In In re Duncan , 85 B.R. 80 (W.D.Wis.1988), the debtor and his wife lived on a farm owned by the debtor prior to their marriage.
When the couple divorced, the debtor received the farm and the wife received a lien upon the farm to secure a cash settlement.
As in the instant case, the lien was created in and by the divorce decree.
Id. at 81 .
The court determined that the bankruptcy court's decision to uphold the lien directly conflicted with "the unambiguous language" of section 522 and therefore reversed.
Id. at 82 .
The "plain intent" of the divorce decree, which granted a lien upon the entire farm, was to declare the debtor the sole owner of the property, subject to his ex-wife's lien.
Whether the non-debtor spouse had a preexisting interest in the farm was thus "simply irrelevant.
It is plain that whatever interest she had was extinguished by the divorce decree " Id. The court thus rejected Boyd and relied on Maus , Pederson , and the dissent in Boyd to conclude that a lien created by a divorce decree to secure payment of a property settlement is avoidable.
Id. at 82-83 .
The facts in the case before us correspond to those in Pederson .
Mr. Sanderfoot was awarded the marital home under the divorce decree subject to Ms. Farrey's lien.
Whether she had prior rights in the residence under Wisconsin law is, in the words of the Western District of Wisconsin, "simply irrelevant."
In re Duncan , 85 B.R. at 82 .
Any preexisting interest Ms. Farrey had in the homestead was dissolved in the divorce proceeding.
Her new interest, created in the dissolution order and evidenced by her lien, attached to Mr. Sanderfoot's interest in the property.
Like the Ninth Circuit, we therefore respectfully decline to follow Boyd .
We conclude that Pederson and its progeny are better reasoned and faithful to the plain language of section 522(f) .
12 Consequently, we conclude that Ms. Farrey's lien attached to Mr. Sanderfoot's interest in the homestead property.
2.
Does the lien impair an exemption to which debtor is entitled?
The parties do not dispute that the real estate at issue constitutes Mr. Sanderfoot's homestead under Wis.Stat.
815.20 and that he thus was entitled to exempt the property from his bankruptcy estate.
See Appellant's Br. at 6.
The question is whether Ms. Farrey's lien impairs that exemption.
Neither the parties nor the courts below focus on this aspect of the lien avoidance statute.
With little discussion, the bankruptcy court determined that the lien impaired Mr. Sanderfoot's homestead exemption, 83 B.R. at 566-67 , and the district court stated that the parties did not dispute the issue, 92 B.R. at 803 .
Indeed, Ms. Farrey did not address this point in either her brief or at oral argument.
Accordingly, we conclude that any challenge has been waived and affirm the determination that the lien impairs the debtor's interest in his homestead property.
We must leave it to the bankruptcy court to determine in the first instance the value of Mr. Sanderfoot's homestead, and thus the exemption amount to which he is entitled.
13 3.
Is the lien a judicial lien?
Under the Bankruptcy Code, a judicial lien is defined as a "lien obtained by judgment, levy, sequestration, or other legal or equitable process or proceeding."
11 U.S.C. 101(32) .
Applying the plain language of the statute, there can be no doubt that Ms. Farrey's lien, granted by the Wisconsin Circuit Court for Outagamie County, was obtained by "legal proceedings."
The bankruptcy court, although concluding that Ms. Farrey's lien could not be avoided, yet conceded that the lien "is without question a type of judicial lien."
83 B.R. at 566 .
The district court similarly determined that "the lien is a judicial lien that impairs Mr. Sanderfoot's homestead exemption."
92 B.R. at 803 .
Ms. Farrey nonetheless maintains that the lien imposed by the divorce court is not a judicial lien.
Therefore, we turn to an examination of her argument.
The same year the Tenth Circuit handed down Maus v. Maus , 837 F.2d 935 (10th Cir.1988), that court decided In re Donahue , 862 F.2d 259 (10th Cir.1988).
The dispute in the Donahue case centered around the terms of a divorce decree pursuant to which the debtor received the marital residence "subject to" a money judgment awarded to the non-debtor spouse.
862 F.2d at 260 .
The Donahue panel determined that the decree created an equitable lien.
Id. at 262-63 .
The court distinguished Maus : Maus Maus Id. at 265 .
The Tenth Circuit subsequently relied on In re Donahue to limit the holding of Maus and declare that a lien in favor of the debtor's former spouse against the debtor's homestead could not be avoided.
In re Borman , 886 F.2d 273 (10th Cir.1989).
The panel explicitly stated that Maus was "limited to the issue of whether a money judgment awarded in a divorce decree can give rise to a lien on homestead property when the divorce decree itself does not specifically create a lien."
Id. at 274 .
Because the debtor in Borman would have been unjustly enriched if allowed to avoid a lien created by the dissolution order, the court imposed an equitable lien and refused to permit its avoidance.
Id. While other courts have echoed a similar rationale, 14 such reasoning is clearly incompatible with the reasoning of In re Pederson that rejected as "implausible and unsupported by the language of the Code" theories advanced by bankruptcy courts for "salvaging liens enforcing property settlements."
875 F.2d at 783 n. 4.
15 Finally, the dissent in Boyd concluded that the state court gave the nondebtor spouse a judicial lien, as opposed to an equitable mortgage or security interest, in the debtor's residence.
16 741 F.2d 1112, 1115 and n. 1 (8th Cir.1984) (Ross, J., dissenting).
Judge Ross noted that the lien granted by the divorce court fit "precisely" within the definition in section 101(32) ; the lien was obtained by judgment because the non-debtor spouse had no interest or lien on the house until the divorce court's order.
Id. at 1115-16 .
Moreover, the lien was not created by an agreement, so did not constitute a security interest.
Nor was it created by contract or conveyance.
It was imposed by the court, so could not be termed a mortgage.
Id. at 1116 .
17 We conclude that, whether liens of the type at issue in this case are called equitable liens or vendor's liens or security interests, they still are "judicial liens" within the definition of section 101(32) and, consequently, are within the embrace of section 522(f)(1) .
The federal definition of "judicial lien," 11 U.S.C. 101(32) , is unambiguous and must control in this instance.
See McKenzie v. Irving Trust Co. , 323 U.S. 365, 369-70 , 65 S.Ct. 405, 407-08 , 89 L.Ed. 305 (1945).
Like the court in In re Boggess , we find the rationale employed in Boyd and its progeny "strained and instead adopt the position of the Pederson line of cases that the Code provisions must be given their plain meaning despite the seemingly inequitable results in a divorce setting."
105 B.R. 470, 474 (Bankr.S.D.Ill.1989).
"Regardless of its own perceptions of fairness, [this] Court must give effect to the policy decisions embodied in the express language of Code provisions," id. at 475 , for as Judge Ross concluded in his dissent, "[i]f state law were allowed to vary what would otherwise be a judicial lien by merely calling the interest an 'equitable mortgage,' havoc would result."
In re Boyd , 741 F.2d at 1115 .
In this case, the lien imposed by the Outagamie County circuit court is a judicial lien as defined in the Code.
It was created by a judgment and it is a "charge against" the property awarded to Mr. Sanderfoot and is designed to secure payment of the $29,000 debt owed to Ms. Farrey.
We thus conclude that the definition of 101(32) is satisfied and the lien is in fact a judicial lien.
Conclusion There are unquestionably a number of opposing interests involved in cases like this one.
The court in In re Worth , 100 B.R. 834, 837 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.1989), noted that it is not uncommon for divorce courts to award exempt property to Spouse A and create a lien on the property in favor of Spouse B. However, 522(f)(1) Id. (footnote omitted).
The court concluded that "[w]hen faced with these disparate issues, it is not surprising that courts have reached different conclusions."
Id.
We recognize the policy arguments against avoidance, but emphasize that it is not for the courts to make policy: "permitting avoidance of this lien" may be "a harsh result," but "[t]his type of decision is for Congress.
Once Congress has decided, its judgment should be respected."
In re Boyd , 741 F.2d 1112, 1116 (8th Cir.1984) (Ross, J., dissenting).
Ms. Farrey urges this court to render a convoluted reading of section 522(f)(1) , given the claimed inequitable result if the statute is read literally.
While we might have struck a different balance than did Congress, we are not free to disregard the clear legislative judgment that debtors may avoid judicial liens of the type at issue.
Perhaps Congress should reexamine the statute, but until it is amended, this court is constrained to apply the law as plainly written.
We therefore decline to follow one of the various routes taken in an effort to prevent "injustice" suggested by Boyd and its progeny because we agree that "the policy considerations at issue have been weighed by Congress and embodied in the language of the Bankruptcy Act.
It is the prerogative of Congress and not of the courts to adjust that balance."
Maus v. Maus , 837 F.2d 935, 940 (10th Cir.1988).
Because it is clear from the face of the statute that Ms. Farrey has a judicial lien that impairs Mr. Sanderfoot's homestead exemption, we conclude that the lien is avoidable under section 522(f)(1) .
Ms. Farrey's lien is fixed on Mr. Sanderfoot's interest in his home, impairs an otherwise proper homestead exemption, and was obtained through the judicial process.
All the elements of section 522(f)(1) are satisfied, and we therefore affirm the district court's determination that the lien is avoidable.
A FFIRMED .
