 ALBERT V. BRYAN , Senior Circuit Judge.
Alleging violation of her rights under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. 621-634 (1970), appellant Frances P. Pons sued her employer, Lorillard, a Division of Loew's Theatres, Inc., 1 for injunctive reinstatement, lost wages, liquidated and punitive 2 damages, costs and attorney's fees.
3 Lorillard's motion to strike Pons' demand for a jury trial on the issue of lost wages was sustained by the District Court and an interlocutory appeal of the order was allowed.

Our task is to determine whether the Seventh Amendment provision for trial by jury "[i]n suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars" applies to a claim under the Age Act for lost wages.
4 Analysis of the problem begins with the language of the Congress.
In relevant part, sections 7(b) and 7(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. 626(b) , (c) state: b legal relief (c) legal relief Our holding is that the inclusion of the phrase "legal .

.
relief" empowers a Federal court to grant complainants the Constitutional right to a jury.
I. At the outset, we are urged to hold that Age Act complaints should follow the pattern of denial thus far adopted in enforcing the provisions against employment discrimination contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5 .
We decline.
Design for decision on this issue is to be found in Curtis v. Loether , 415 U.S. 189 , 94 S.Ct. 1005 , 39 L.Ed.2d 260 (1974), declaring the availability of a jury in a civil action under Title VIII, section 812(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 3601 , 3612(c) , relating to fair housing.
This section, as relevant, defines the powers of the court: In Curtis the Court contrasts Title VII--fair employment--and Title VIII--fair housing--enforcement clauses, concluding that the decisions 5 rejecting a jury trial in Title VII are not construing remedial provisions like those in VIII.
415 U.S. at 196 , 94 S.Ct. 1005 .
To repeat, the Court quite cautiously disavows any interpretation of VII, saying only that its language is not the same as that of VIII.
Its distinguishment of the phrasing warrants a lengthy quotation: 812 Id. at 197 , 94 S.Ct. at 1010 .
Equivalent differentiation is apparent between the Title VII remedies and those of the Age Act.
Comparing the two as they have just now been set forth, it is seen at once that the Age Act includes the terminology of a law action, traditionally calling for a jury verdict, rather than only a suit in equity to be decided and decreed by a chancellor.
Thus it comprises the power to grant legal relief, that is relief at law--obviously a suit "at common law" embodied in the Seventh Amendment.
II.
The Age Act by its very terms excludes the non-jury concept and commands the impanelment of a jury, if requested, in claims for lost wages.
Forthright to prove this view is the incorporation of related provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act into the enforcement section of the Age Act, 29 U.S.C. 626(b) , as follows: 216 subsection (a) 217 subsection (c) sections 216 217 The Fair Labor Standards Act provision, 29 U.S.C. 216 (except subsection (a) ), supra, stipulates: section 206 section 207 Thus the Age Act clearly equates lost wages as "unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation" under the FLSA.
It is settled that section 216(b) claims are legal in nature and uniformly accorded a jury trial.

at 664 and cases cited.
The ultimate analysis to determine whether a suit is one "at common law" within the Amendment seems to be the three-pronged classical test: (1) Is the issue legal rather than equitable under the custom of the courts of law; (2) Is the remedy legal; and (3) Is the issue triable to a jury given the jurors' practical abilities and limitations?
Ross v. Bernhard , 396 U.S. 531, 538 fn.
10, 90 S.Ct. 733 , 24 L.Ed.2d 729 (1970); see 5 Moore's Federal Practice 38.16 pp.
162.6-8.
Where issues of law and equity are intertwined in one suit, those meeting the three-pronged test merit a trial by jury.
6 Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood , 369 U.S. 469, 470-73 , 82 S.Ct. 894 , 8 L.Ed.2d 44 (1962).
It has been helpfully observed that claims of employment discrimination, coupled with prayers for lost wages, are analogous to the common law action for breach of contract by wrongful discharge or an action in tort, with the Age Act creating the legal duty.
Cleverly v. Western Electric Co. , 69 F.R.D. at 350-51 .
To interpret this cause of action as one "incidental" or "integral" to the equitable issue of reinstatement would be to violate the rule of Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood , 369 U.S. at 470 , 82 S.Ct. 894 , as just mentioned.
As to the second and third phases of the Ross test, we believe that a monetary award for back wages is a traditional legal remedy and that the computation of such an award would not be beyond the practical capabilities of a jury.
Cleverly v. Western Electric Co. , 69 F.R.D. at 351 .
Consequently, all of the prerequisites to a trial by jury under the Age Act are satisfied.
Hence we hold the jury demand should not have been denied.
That order is now vacated and the claim for back pay is remanded for trial by a jury.
7 Vacated and remanded.
