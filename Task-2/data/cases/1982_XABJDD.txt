 OPINION OF THE COURT ALDISERT , Circuit Judge.
The question presented by this appeal is whether the provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) that bars claims "arising in respect of the detention of any goods or merchandise by any officer of customs ," 28 U.S.C. 2680(c) , precludes a claim against the United States for negligent damage to property while in the legitimate custody of the Customs Service.
We conclude that it does and therefore affirm the judgment of the district court that dismissed appellant's complaint.
I. On February 28, 1978, Customs Service agents seized certain antiques and objects of art from the home of Joseph Kosak.
He was subsequently charged with smuggling goods into the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. 545 , but was found not guilty.
The Customs Service returned the detained property to him but Kosak contended that certain items had been damaged as a result of Customs Service negligence during the detention.
Alleging jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1346(b) , 1 he brought this FTCA action in district court seeking $12,310 in damages.
The Government responded that Kosak's claim was barred because it fell under 28 U.S.C. 2680(c) .
The district court dismissed the complaint.
2 Section 2680 enumerates several exceptions to the FTCA's general relaxation of tort immunity.
Section 2680(c) specifies: section 1346(b) Finding no decision of this court interpreting this section of the FTCA, appellant invites us to adopt the interpretation of the Second Circuit, as announced in Alliance Assurance Co. v. United States , 252 F.2d 529 (2d Cir. 1958), which held that 2680(c) applies only to claims based on injury caused by detention itself and not to losses caused by the Customs Service's negligent handling of goods during detention.
II.
The courts are divided in their interpretations of this section.
3 The divergence stems from the phrase "arising in respect of the detention of any goods " The Alliance court speculated that the 252 F.2d at 534 .
Comparing 28 U.S.C. 2680(b) 's explicit preclusion of actions against the postal system "arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission" of mail, the Alliance court reasoned that if Congress had intended to bar actions claiming negligence of the customs officials, it would have done so in like manner.
We disagree.
Alliance's rationale ignores the clear language of 2680(c) , the legislative intent, and specific teachings of the Supreme Court regarding interpretation of exceptions to the FTCA.
Statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute itself.
Reiter v. Sonotone Corp. 442 U.S. 330, 337 99 S.Ct. 2326, 2330 60 L.Ed.2d 931 Richards v. United States 369 U.S. 1, 9 82 S.Ct. 585, 590 7 L.Ed.2d 492 Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc. 447 U.S. 102, 108 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056 64 L.Ed.2d 766 American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson , U.S. , , 102 S.Ct. 1534, 1537 , 71 L.Ed.2d 748 (1982).
4 In our view, the language of the statute covers all claims arising out of detention of goods by customs officers and does not purport to distinguish among types of harm.
Moreover, the legislative history of 2680(c) reveals no "clearly expressed legislative intention" contrary to the ordinary meaning of the section's language.
The section-by-section analysis contained in the committee report on the bill provides only a brief statement that the group of exceptions that includes the exception for claims arising out of the detention of goods by customs officers covers "claims which relate to certain governmental activities which should be free from the threat of damage suit, or for which adequate remedies are already available."

There is nothing in the legislative history to show that this exemption was to be restricted to claims in conversion.
Our examination of the purposes of the statutory schema reinforces our view.
In Dalehite v. United States , 346 U.S. 15 , 73 S.Ct. 956 , 97 L.Ed. 1427 (1953), the Court makes clear that sovereign immunity is the rule, and that legislative departures from the rule must be strictly construed.
The Court observed that the FTCA was an example of the step-by-step legislative relaxation of sovereign immunity and teaches that in interpreting these statutory modifications and their exceptions, Federal Housing Administration v. Burr 309 U.S. 242, 251 60 S.Ct. 488, 493 84 L.Ed. 724 346 U.S. at 31 , 73 S.Ct. at 965 (footnotes omitted).
Exceptions to the government's relaxation of immunity "are not to be nullified through judicial interpretation, since Congress clearly delineated the areas in which it did not intend to forfeit its immunity from suit."
Builders Corp. of America v. United States , 320 F.2d 425, 426 (9th Cir. 1963), cert. denied , 376 U.S. 906 , 84 S.Ct. 660 , 11 L.Ed.2d 606 (1964).
Reading 2680(c) in this light, we find no "clear relinquishment of sovereign immunity."
TVA v. Hill 437 U.S. 153 98 S.Ct. 2279 57 L.Ed.2d 117 Industrial Union Department v. American Petroleum Institute , 448 U.S. 607, 688 , 100 S.Ct. 2844, 2887 , 65 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1980) (Marshall, J., dissenting).
Appellant's claim arises from detention of goods by a customs officer, and therefore, whether it arises in negligence or in conversion, it is barred by 2680(c) .
III.
The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.
