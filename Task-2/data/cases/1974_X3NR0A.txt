 STEPHENSON , Circuit Judge.
This appeal from the order of a statutory three-judge district court dismissing plaintiffs' cause of action for lack of standing raises troublesome questions of jurisdiction and procedure as well as a question concerning state interference with the abortion decision.
The three-judge court opinion is reported as Wulff v. State Board of Registration for Healing Arts , 380 F.Supp.
1137 (E.D.Mo.1974).
We reverse.
Appellants, Missouri licensed medical doctors, brought a three count complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Missouri State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts and against Thomas E. Singleton in his capacity as Chief of the Bureau of Medical Services.
The complaint challenged the constitutionality of state statutes regarding welfare benefits, claiming that the statutory wording 380 F.Supp.
1137, 1139 .
The three-judge court dismissed Count II of the complaint for lack of standing by the medical doctors to challenge the constitutionality of the statute.
See Wulff , supra at 1144 .
Appeal was filed in this court.
1 I. APPELLATE JURISDICTION The portal question we have goes to the propriety of an appeal to this court from an order entered by a district court of three judges.
2 That inquiry has been settled for us in the instant case by the United States Supreme Court's recent decision in Gonzalez v. Automatic Employees Credit Union , 419 U.S. 90 , 95 S.Ct. 289 , 42 L.Ed.2d 249 (filed December 10, 1974).
In Gonzalez appellant took his appeal directly to the Supreme Court from a three-judge court order dismissing the complaint for lack of standing.
The court observed that when the basis of decision by a three-judge court is lack of standing, the case is such that "a single judge could have declined to convene a three-judge court" or "the three-judge court could have dissolved itself, leaving final disposition of the complaint to a single judge."
Gonzalez , at 100, 95 S.Ct. at 295 (footnote omitted).
The Court went on to say: ab initio 419 U.S. 90, 101 , 95 S.Ct. 289, 296 .
This court has jurisdiction in the instant case. II.
STANDING The district court found that there was no logical nexus between the status of appellant-physicians and the claims they sought to have adjudicated.
Flast v. Cohen , 392 U.S. 83 , 88 S.Ct. 1942 , 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968).
We disagree.
This court made clear in Nyberg v. City of Virginia , 495 F.2d 1342 (1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 891 , 95 S.Ct. 169 , 42 L.Ed.2d 136 : Roe v. Wade 410 U.S. 113 93 S.Ct. 705 35 L.Ed.2d 147 Doe v. Bolton 410 U.S. 179 93 S.Ct. 739 35 L.Ed.2d 201 .

Arkansas 393 U.S. 97 89 S.Ct. 266 21 L.Ed.2d 228 We reiterated the same thought more succinctly in Word v. Poelker , 495 F.2d 1349, 1350 (8th Cir. 1974), where we said: Roe v. Wade 410 U.S. 113 93 S.Ct. 705 35 L.Ed.2d 147 Doe v. Bolton 410 U.S. 179 93 S.Ct. 739 35 L.Ed.2d 201 Doe v. Bolton supra at 188 93 S.Ct. 739 Roe v. Wade supra 165 of 410 U.S. 93 S.Ct. 705 See Orr v. Koefoot , 377 F.Supp.
673, 678 (D.Neb.1974); Poe v. Menghini , 339 F.Supp.

, 507 F.2d 1281 (8th Cir., filed November 7, 1974).
The statute in question interferes with the doctor-patient relationship as it relates to the abortion decision.
It injects unnecessarily restrictive rules upon a constitutionally protected decision of doctor and patient as surely as did the statutes in the above cited cases.
The statute interferes with the appellants' practice of medicine both professionally and monetarily.
We think that there is no question that (1) appellants allege that the challenged acts have caused them "injury in fact, economic or otherwise" and (2) "the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question."
Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp , 397 U.S. 150, 152-153 , 90 S.Ct. 827, 829-830 , 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970).
To hold otherwise in light of the authority cited above would defy logic.
These medical doctors have standing to pursue this action.
III.
THIS COURT'S JURISDICTION TO REACH THE MERITS We are urged by appellants to reach the merits of this case rather than remand to the three-judge court.
This question is not without its difficulty.
There is little direct authority for the propriety of our reaching the merits.
Nevertheless, we are satisfied that under the circumstances of this case and in the interest of judicial economy and logic we should now address the merits of this controversy.
Of course, the three-judge court has not determined the merits.
This court is not generally a court of original jurisdiction.
Even so, there is authority for the proposition that when a case is properly before a Court of Appeals, the court has the power "to do what plainly ought to be done."
Mercury Motor Express, Inc. v. Brinke , 475 F.2d 1086, 1091 (5th Cir. 1973), citing 9 Moore's Federal Practice 110.25 (2d ed. 1972).
In reaching the merits of a case which was before the court pursuant to an interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1292(b) this court said: Borden's Farm Products Co. v. Baldwin 293 U.S. 194, at 213 55 S.Ct. 187 79 L.Ed. 281 United States v. Petrillo 332 U.S. 1 67 S.Ct. 1538 91 L.Ed. 1877 United States v. Fabro, Inc. 206 F.Supp.
523 Turner v. City of Memphis 369 U.S. 350 82 S.Ct. 805 7 L.Ed.2d 762 Board of Managers of Ark. Tr. Sch. for Boys v. George , 377 F.2d 228, 231 (8th Cir. 1967).
In addition, Mr. Justice Clark in writing for the Supreme Court has indicated that effective judicial administration requires disposal of the case on appeal rather than remanding, where the point to be decided is clear.
Levin v. Mississippi River Fuel Corporation , 386 U.S. 162, 170 , 87 S.Ct. 927, 932 , 17 L.Ed.2d 834 .
It might be argued that the above authority, though persuasive, should not apply in the instance of an appeal to the Court of Appeals from a statutory three-judge court.
The Supreme Court has made it clear that the three-judge court mandate must be construed quite narrowly.
"Congress established the three-judge court apparatus for one reason: to save state and federal statutes from improvident doom, on constitutional grounds, at the hands of a single federal district judge."
Gonzalez , supra , 419 U.S. 97 , 95 S.Ct. 294 .
For this court to get to the heart of the matter and dispose of this case on the merits will not conflict with the policy behind the statute.
Indeed, we think this case is particularly proper for disposition in this court since "[w]hile 2281 calls for three judges to enjoin a statute 'upon the ground' of its 'unconstitutionality,' we [the Supreme Court] have held that three judges are not in fact, necessary where the unconstitutionality of the statute is obvious and patent *."
Gonzalez , supra, at 97 , 95 S.Ct. at 294 , footnote 14, citing Bailey v. Patterson , 369 U.S. 31 , 82 S.Ct. 549 , 7 L.Ed.2d 512 (1962).
The statute in question is obviously unconstitutional, and it is our view that the case might well have been decided by one federal judge.
See generally Roe v. Norton , 380 F.Supp.
726, 728 (D.Conn.1974).
Accordingly, we choose to make final determination of this case. IV.
MERITS The statute before the court states: As in Word v. Poelker , supra 495 F.2d 1349, 1350 , the issue in this case concerns the facial constitutionality of the statute viewed against the glare of the Supreme Court's decisions in Roe v. Wade; Doe v. Bolton, and the precedent which has developed as a result of those cases.
We find it unnecessary to review again Roe and Doe or what this court has said in applying those cases.
Suffice it to say that the statute here provides medical payments if the pregnancy is carried to term or for therapeutic abortions but not if a nontherapeutic abortion is performed.
This classification is a clear violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
There is ample case authority for the holding that a welfare payments statute which places special regulation on abortion but not upon other medical procedures cannot stand in light of the Supreme Court decisions.
Doe v. Rose , 499 F.2d 1112 (10th Cir. 1974); Doe v. Westby , 383 F.Supp.
1143 (W.D.S.D., filed September 24, 1974); Roe v. Norton , 380 F.Supp.
726 (D.Conn.1974); Doe v. Wohlgemuth , 376 F.Supp.
173 (W.D.Pa.1974); Doe v. Rampton , 366 F.Supp.
189 (D.Utah 1973); Klein v. Nassau Co.
Medical Center , 347 F.Supp.
496 (E.D.N.Y.1972); see also Doe v. Hale Hospital , 500 F.2d 144 (1st Cir. 1974).
The control meted out by this statute does not give proper consideration to the conflicting constitutional interests involved.
Word , supra , 495 F.2d at 1351 .
It is further invalid since the welfare parent and her physician are discriminated against by reason of the patient's poverty.
Compare, e. g. , Klein , supra .
We declare RSMo 208.152(12) , V.A.M.S., to be unconstitutional on its face.
Injunctive relief should be unnecessary.
We assume that the state will abide by the ruling of this court and that medical assistance payments will be made on a nondisparate basis to those eligible needy persons who elect to carry their pregnancy to term or who receive therapeutic abortions and also to those who elect nontherapeutic abortions.
Reversed.
PER CURIAM.
Appellants seek clarification of our holding and further request that we award to appellants a reasonable attorney fee.
It was the Court's intention and we now reiterate our holding that that portion of RSMo 208.152(12) , V.A.M.S., which states "that such family planning services shall not include abortions unless such abortions are medically indicated" is unconstitutional.
The application for attorney fee is denied.
