 CORNELIA G. KENNEDY , Circuit Judge.
These consolidated appeals present the question whether section 15(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA"), as amended, 29 U.S.C. 215(a)(1) , applies to holders of collateral obtained pursuant to perfected security interests.
The United States District Courts for the Eastern and Western Districts of Tennessee held that the FLSA applies to secured creditors.
For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.
On December 14, 1983, defendant-appellant, Citicorp Industrial Credit, Inc. ("Citicorp"), and Qualitex Corporation, an earlier name for a group of companies consisting of Ely Group, Inc. ("Ely Group") and its subsidiaries, Rockford Textile Mills, Inc. ("Rockford") and Ely & Walker, Inc. ("Ely & Walker"), (collectively "Ely"), signed a financing agreement.
Under this "zero balance" 1 financing arrangement, Citicorp agreed, in its discretion, to loan up to $11,000,000 to provide the general working capital for Ely. As security for the loans, Ely granted Citicorp a security interest in inventory, accounts receivable, and various other assets.
Citicorp filed financing statements and other appropriate documentation to perfect its security interests so that Citicorp undisputably qualifies as a perfected secured creditor.
In accordance with the financing agreement, Ely submitted various daily, weekly, and monthly reports to Citicorp.
In the fall of 1984, Ely started missing sales projections.
Accordingly, the loan balance considerably exceeded projections.
In January 1985, Ely stopped sending reports to Citicorp.
A Citicorp field examination determined that Ely's computerized accounting system was not functioning properly.
By early February 1985, Ely's loan balance had increased to approximately $9,500,000.
February 8, 1985 was the last day Citicorp advanced any funds to Ely. On February 11, 1985, Citicorp ceased funding Ely's operations.
Ely's employees, however, continued working until February 19, 1985, when Citicorp foreclosed, taking possession of the collateral, and Ely ceased operations.
Since Ely defaulted on its payroll, its employees did not receive any wages for various workweeks, dating from January 27, 1985 to February 19, 1985.
Consequently, the goods that Ely produced during this period were produced in violation of the FLSA's minimum wage and overtime provisions.
2 Acting on information that Citicorp planned to ship the goods in interstate commerce, the Department of Labor brought these actions to enjoin the shipment of the goods under 29 U.S.C. 215(a)(1) .
On March 15, 1985, Raymond J. Donovan, Secretary of Labor, United States Department of Labor, 3 filed a complaint and a motion for preliminary injunction and application for temporary restraining order in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, to enjoin Rockford, Ely Group, and Citicorp from placing goods allegedly produced in violation of the FLSA's minimum wage and overtime provisions in interstate commerce.
The District Court denied the application for a temporary restraining order on March 15, 1985.
After hearing arguments, the District Court granted the motion for preliminary injunction on March 22, 1985.
Donovan v. Rockford Textile Mills, Inc. , 608 F.Supp.
215 (E.D.Tenn.1985).
Citicorp filed a notice of appeal from that ruling, which the Clerk of this Court docketed as No. 85-5249.
On April 10, 1985, the District Court granted Citicorp's motion for a stay or suspension of injunction pending appeal.
On March 21, 1985, Ford B. Ford, Under Secretary of Labor, United States Department of Labor, 4 filed a related complaint and motion for preliminary injunction and application for temporary restraining order in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee against Ely Group, Rockford, Ely & Walker, and Citicorp.
The District Court, following a telephone conference with counsel, granted the temporary restraining order on March 22, 1985.
Following a hearing, the District Court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction on March 27, 1985.
Citicorp filed a notice of appeal, which the Clerk of this Court docketed as No. 85-5252.
On March 28, 1985, the District Court denied Citicorp's motion to stay or suspend the injunction.
Citicorp immediately filed a motion for a stay pending appeal in this Court, agreeing to pay the unpaid employees the statutorily required wages in the event that this Court concluded that 29 U.S.C. 215(a)(1) applies to Citicorp.
This Court granted the requested stay on March 29, 1985.
Title 29 U.S.C. 215(a)(1) , 5 the FLSA's "hot goods" provision, prohibits "any person" from shipping, delivering, or selling, in interstate commerce, goods that were produced in violation of FLSA's minimum wage and overtime provisions.
Title 29 U.S.C. 203(a) defines "person" as "an individual, partnership, association, corporation, business trust, legal representative, or any organized group of persons."
Citicorp thus falls within the "plain meaning" of the statute.
Citicorp, however, cites Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States , 143 U.S. 457 , 12 S.Ct. 511 , 36 L.Ed. 226 (1892); for the proposition that this Court should look beyond the plain meaning of the statute.
In Church of the Holy Trinity , the Supreme Court stated: Id. at 459 , 12 S.Ct. at 512 .
See also United Steelworkers of America v. Weber , 443 U.S. 193, 201 , 99 S.Ct. 2721, 2726 , 61 L.Ed.2d 480 , reh'g denied , 444 U.S. 889 , 100 S.Ct. 193 , 62 L.Ed.2d 125 (1979).
Although courts may look behind the "plain meaning" of a statute when a literal construction would produce a nonsensical result or "'bring about an end completely at variance with the purpose of the statute,'" id. at 202 , 99 S.Ct. at 2726 (quoting United States v. Public Utilities Commission , 345 U.S. 295, 315 , 73 S.Ct. 706 , 97 L.Ed. 1020 , reh'g denied , 345 U.S. 961 , 73 S.Ct. 935 , 97 L.Ed. 1380 (1953)), we conclude that applying the "hot goods" provision to secured creditors, in fact, furthers one purpose of the FLSA, which is to keep goods that were produced in violation of the FLSA out of interstate commerce.
In United States v. Darby , 312 U.S. 100 , 61 S.Ct. 451 , 85 L.Ed. 609 (1941), the Supreme Court, after examining the declaration of policy in 2(a) of the FLSA, codified at 29 U.S.C. 202(a) , 6 and the FLSA's legislative history, stated that the purpose of the FLSA and Id. at 109-10 , 61 S.Ct. at 455 (emphasis added).
While discussing 15(a)(1) of the FLSA, the Court stated: Id. at 115 , 61 S.Ct. at 457 .
See also Roland Electric Co. v. Walling , 326 U.S. 657, 667-69 , 66 S.Ct. 413, 417-19 , 90 L.Ed. 383 (1946).
Consequently, one of the reasons that Congress passed the FLSA was to exclude tainted goods from interstate commerce.
Since Congress wanted to exclude goods that were produced in violation of the FLSA's minimum wage and overtime provisions from interstate commerce, prohibiting secured creditors, such as Citicorp, from shipping "hot goods" in interstate commerce furthers that Congressional intent.
Accordingly, we follow the "plain language" of the statute and conclude that the phrase "any person" applies to Citicorp, as a secured creditor.
7 In reaching this conclusion, we refuse to follow and reject the reasoning of the Second Circuit in Wirtz v. Powell Knitting Mills Company, Inc. , 360 F.2d 730 (2d Cir.1966).
In Powell Knitting Mills , the Second Circuit created a "judicial exception" to the FLSA by holding that FLSA 15 did not prohibit a factor, which had foreclosed its lien on an insolvent manufacturer, from selling the manufacturer's sweaters in interstate commerce on the ground that the manufacturer had produced the sweaters in violation of FLSA's minimum wage provisions.
In Shultz v. Factors, Inc. , 65 Lab.Cas.
(CCH) ¶ 32,487 (4th Cir.1971), the Fourth Circuit followed Powell Knitting Mills with little discussion but added an additional requirement "that there be no collusion between the manufacturer and his financier permitting the introduction into the market of goods produced in violation of the Act."
See also Dunlop v. Sportsmaster, Inc. , 77 Lab.Cas.
(CCH) ¶ 33,293 (E.D.Tenn.1975).
In Powell Knitting Mills , supra , the Secretary of Labor appealed from a district court order vacating a temporary restraining order that the district court had issued against a manufacturer of sweaters and the manufacturer's factor.
The vacated order prohibited the factor from selling certain sweaters that the factor had acquired when it foreclosed its lien.
The manufacturer had not paid eighty-six of its employees wages totaling $8,425 for the weeks ending February 18, February 25, and March 5, 1966.
Beginning September 2, 1965, the factor had made approximately $700,000 in cash advances to the manufacturer, secured by liens on the manufacturer's inventory and equipment.
The factor filed financing statements.
On March 8, 1966, the manufacturer ceased operations and made an assignment for the benefit of creditors.
The factor foreclosed and the Secretary of Labor brought the action to enjoin the sale of certain sweaters which had been produced during the time when the manufacturer had not paid wages.
The Second Circuit acknowledged that "[u]nder a literal, or, as Judge Zavatt called it, 'wooden' reading of the Act, the government would be entitled to an injunction."
Id. at 732 .
The court of appeals recognized that one purpose of the FLSA's "hot goods" provision "was to prevent adverse competitive effects on those who comply with the Act."
Id. at 733 .
The Second Circuit, however, stated that "[h]ere there can be no connection between the asserted violation and any effects on competition."
Id. Although the court also recognized that another purpose of the "hot goods" provision was to assure that "wage earners would be paid," the court "[found] it hard to believe that Congress contemplated that the foreclosing creditor would have to pay the wage earners to avoid 15 ."
Id. The court observed that "restraining the sale in interstate commerce (until the wage claims were paid) comes close to giving such wage claims a priority over secured creditors contrary to the scheme of the Bankruptcy Act."
Id. See 11 U.S.C. 507 .
The court concluded: Id .
Accordingly, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court order vacating the temporary restraining order.
Although we are reluctant to create an intercircuit conflict, we cannot agree with the Second Circuit's "judicially created exception."
8 The Second Circuit's reasoning conflicts with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the purposes of the FLSA in United States v. Darby , supra .
Congress does not want "hot goods" to taint the channels of interstate commerce.
Furthermore, the "hot goods" in this case will compete with goods produced in conformity with the FLSA's minimum wage and overtime provisions if Citicorp places the goods in interstate commerce.
The FLSA protects manufacturers who comply with the minimum wage and overtime provisions by keeping "hot goods" out of interstate commerce.
9 Our holding does not change the priorities in bankruptcy.
Citicorp "owns" the goods.
The "hot goods" provision merely prevents Citicorp from shipping, delivering, or selling the goods in interstate commerce.
Finally, the equities of the situation balance somewhere between Citicorp and the employees.
Although Citicorp provided the capital and the materials for the production of the goods, that does not dictate that Citicorp should receive the benefits of the employees' labor during the three weeks which they worked on the goods but were not paid.
Congress has created only two exceptions--one for common carriers and one for good faith purchasers--to the broad scope of 29 U.S.C. 215(a)(1) , which otherwise applies to "any person."
10 Citicorp definitely does not qualify as a common carrier.
Citicorp has not raised the issue whether it could qualify as a good faith purchaser.
We do observe, however, that although the extension of credit might qualify as a "purchase," Citicorp does not qualify as a "good faith purchaser" because Citicorp did not rely "on written assurance from the producer that the goods were produced in compliance with the requirements of [the FLSA]."
11 29 U.S.C. 215(a)(1) .
We agree that Congress never directly considered the question whether the "hot goods" provision applies to secured creditors.
Nevertheless, Citicorp should not be in a better position as a secured creditor, for which Congress has not created an exception, than as a "good faith purchaser," for which Congress specifically added an exception.
Consequently, we conclude that Powell Knitting Mills created an exception for secured creditors that Congress did not and has not deemed appropriate.
We, therefore, reject the reasoning in Powell Knitting Mills and hold that 29 U.S.C. 215(a)(1) applies to secured creditors.
Accordingly, we affirm the orders of the District Courts granting the preliminary injunctions enjoining Citicorp from placing the goods in interstate commerce.
