 EDWARDS , Circuit Judge.
At issue in this case is the power of the Attorney General of the United States as agent of the President to authorize wiretapping in internal security matters without judicial sanction.
This case has importance far beyond its facts or the litigants concerned.
If decided in favor of the government, the citizens of these United States lose the protection of an independent judicial review of the cause and reasonableness of secret recordation by federal law enforcement of thoughts and expressions which had been uttered in privacy.
If it is decided in favor of the respondent, it may prejudice an important criminal prosecution.
And more important, of course, in all future surveillances undertaken in internal security matters, it may add at least some dimension of risk of exposure of federal investigatorial intentions.
The background of this case is the pending trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in Detroit of three young men for conspiracy to destroy government property in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 371 (1964).
One of them named Plamondon was also charged with destruction of government property in a value exceeding $100, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1361 (1964).
The particular case before us is a petition for writ of mandamus filed originally in this court by the United States to compel the District Judge who is presiding at the Detroit trial to vacate an order directing the United States to "make full disclosure to defendant Plamondon of his monitored conversations."
STATEMENT OF FACTS For purposes of this case, we accept the statement of facts from the petition filed by the United States: 18 U.S.C. 1361 1 1.
It is important to note at this point that although he was overheard, defendant Plamondon was not the object of the surveillance.
This distinction apparently went unnoticed by respondent for he stated in his decision ordering disclosure that the Attorney General 'had authorized and deemed necessary the wire tapping of certain of defendant Plamondon's conversations.'
"The sealed exhibit submitted to the court below will quickly demonstrate that defendant Plamondon was not the object of the surveillance, and petitioner respectfully refers this Court's attention to that exhibit and the additional sealed exhibit being made available to the Court for the grounds and objectives of the Attorney General's authorization."
(Footnote in quotation.)
in camera To this statement of facts the United States also attached the affidavit of Attorney General Mitchell--the full context of which follows: in camera in camera This court stayed the order of the District Court pending hearing and final disposition of the petition for writ of mandamus.
From the above-quoted statement of facts, it appears that the exact question this court must answer is: Where the Attorney General determines that certain wiretaps are "necessary to protect the nation from attempts of domestic organizations to attack and subvert the existing structure of the government," does his authorization render such wiretaps lawful without judicial review?
THE MANDAMUS QUESTION Preliminary to answering this question, there is a challenge to our jurisdiction.
It is claimed that mandamus is not an appropriate form of action in which to review the question just posed in the context of the instant case.
It is clear that the District Court order under attack is a pretrial order interlocutory in nature, and hence, not appealable under 28 U.S.C. 1291 (1964) which conveys appellate power to this court to review only "final" orders of the District Courts.
Cogen v. United States , 278 U.S. 221 , 49 S.Ct. 118 , 73 L.Ed. 275 (1929).
Nor is the order here under attack subject to appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1292 (1964), which grants appellate power to this court in certain limited classes of interlocutory orders, nor under 18 U.S.C. 3731 (Supp. V, 1965-69), which deals specifically with criminal appeals.
1 It is, of course, the general rule that mandamus may not be substituted for appeal.
Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass'n.
, 319 U.S. 21, 30-31 , 63 S.Ct. 938 , 87 L.Ed. 1185 (1943); Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Holland , 346 U.S. 379, 382 , 74 S.Ct. 145 , 98 L.Ed. 106 (1953); Black v. Boyd , 248 F.2d 156, 159 (6th Cir. 1957); Hoffa v. Gray , 323 F.2d 178, 179 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 907 , 84 S.Ct. 199 , 11 L.Ed.2d 147 (1963); University National Stockholders Protective Comm., Inc. v. University National Life Ins. Co. , 328 F.2d 425, 426 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 933 , 84 S.Ct. 1335 , 12 L.Ed.2d 296 (1964).
Petitioner United States, however, points to the All Writs Statute ( 28 U.S.C. 1651 (1964)) as source of this court's power to grant the writ prayed for and argues that this is an extraordinary case wherein the respondent has entered an illegal order which if allowed to stand, "would result in grave and irreparable harm to legitimate Governmental interests."
Concerning the use of mandamus in "exceptional cases," this court has said: Black v. Boyd 248 F.2d 156, 159-160 See also Ex parte United States , 287 U.S. 241 , 53 S.Ct. 129 , 77 L.Ed. 283 (1932); La Buy v. Howes Leather Co. , 352 U.S. 249 , 77 S.Ct. 309 , 1 L.Ed.2d 290 (1957); Will v. United States , 389 U.S. 90, 95-98 , 88 S.Ct. 269 , 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967).
In this last case, Justice Black in a concurring opinion said: Will v. United States supra 389 U.S. at 108 88 S.Ct. at 280 From what has already been said, it is obvious that we agree that this is in all respects an extraordinary case. Great issues are at stake for all parties concerned.
Further, the government asserts the illegality of the order, that it represents an abuse of the District Judge's discretion, and claims that it will have the effect of forcing the government to dismiss the prosecution of one defendant.
If this were not enough to occasion our deciding this case on the merits rather than on procedural grounds, it also clearly appears that the issue posed here is a basic issue which has never been decided at the appellate level by any court.
It has been decided favorably to the government's position by two District Courts and adversely to the government by two others.
2 The Courts of Appeals have the power to review by mandamus "an issue of first impression," Schlagenhauf v. Holder , 379 U.S. 104, 110 , 85 S.Ct. 234 , 13 L.Ed.2d 152 (1964), involving a "basic and undecided problem."
Id. at 110 , 85 S.Ct. 234 .
We hold that this court has jurisdiction to decide this petition.
THE FOURTH AMENDMENT The District Judge in issuing the disclosure order relied upon the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which provides: In a series of cases, the United States Supreme Court has held that electronic surveillance and recordation by wiretap is a search and seizure governed by the Fourth Amendment.
Silverman v. United States , 365 U.S. 505 , 81 S.Ct. 679 , 5 L.Ed.2d 734 (1961); Katz v. United States , 389 U.S. 347 , 88 S.Ct. 507 , 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967); Alderman v. United States , 394 U.S. 165 , 89 S.Ct. 961 , 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969); Giordano v. United States , 394 U.S. 310 , 89 S.Ct. 1163 , 22 L.Ed.2d 297 (1969); Taglianetti v. United States , 394 U.S. 316 , 89 S.Ct. 1099 , 22 L.Ed. 302 (1969).
The basic holding of these cases is set forth in the Katz case by Mr. Justice Stewart: Olmstead [v. United States 277 U.S. 438 48 S.Ct. 564 72 L.Ed. 944 Goldman [v. United States 316 U.S. 129 62 S.Ct. 993 86 L.Ed. 1322 Agnello v. United States 269 U.S. 20, 33 46 S.Ct. 4, 6 70 L.Ed. 145 Wong Sun v.

20 "20.
In Agnello v. United States , 269 U.S. 20, 30 [ 46 S.Ct. 4, 5 , 70 L.Ed. 145 ], the Court stated: 'The right without a search warrant contemporaneously to search persons lawfully arrested while committing crime and to search the place where the arrest is made in order to find and seize things connected with the crime as its fruits or as the means by which it was committed, as well as weapons and other things to effect an escape from custody, is not to be doubted.'
Whatever one's view of 'the long-standing practice of searching for other proofs of guilt within the control of the accused found upon arrest,' United States v. Rabinowitz , 339 U.S. 56, 61 [ 70 S.Ct. 430, 433 , 94 L.Ed. 653 ]; cf. id., at 71-79 [ 70 S.Ct. at 437-441 ] (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter), the concept of an 'incidental' search cannot readily be extended to include surreptitious surveillance of an individual either immediately before, or immediately after, his arrest.
21 "21.
Although '[t]he Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to delay in the course of an investigation if to do so would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others,' Warden v. Hayden , 387 U.S. 294, 298-299 [ 87 S.Ct. 1642, 1646 , 18 L.Ed.2d 782 ], there seems little likelihood that electronic surveillance would be a realistic possibility in a situation so fraught with urgency.
22 "22.
A search to which an individual consents meets Fourth Amendment requirements, Zap v. United States , 328 U.S. 624 [ 66 S.Ct. 1277 , 90 L.Ed. 1477 ], but of course 'the usefulness of electronic surveillance depends on lack of notice to the suspect.'
Lopez v. United States , 373 U.S. 427, 463 [ 83 S.Ct. 1381, 1401 , 10 L.Ed.2d 462 ] (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan)."
Katz v. United States 389 U.S. 347, 356-358 88 S.Ct. 507, 514-515 These cases and the requirement of judicial review just quoted represent settled law which the government does not dispute as generally applicable.
It is, as we have noted, however, the government's position that in "national security" cases the President of the United States, in his capacity as Chief Executive, has unique powers of the "sovereign" which serve to exempt him and his agents from the judicial review restrictions of the Fourth Amendment.
THE PRESIDENTIAL POWER The sweep of the assertion of the Presidential power is both eloquent and breathtaking.
In the memorandum of law filed with its petition, the government asserts: This power is the historical power of the sovereign to preserve itself In a supplemental memorandum, the claim is somewhat broadened: We find in the government's brief no suggestion of limitations on such power, nor, indeed, any recognition that the sovereign power of this nation is by Constitution distributed among three coordinate branches of government.
While the government briefs do not identify them, there are important constitutional grants of power to the President of the United States.
We find these express powers of the President of the United States set forth in the Constitution which are arguably relevant to this case: 1 2 3 No express grant of power to the President to make searches and seizures without regard to the Fourth Amendment may be found in these constitutional provisions.
As we have noted, the government cites no constitutional language to support its position, but it does cite some case law.
Decision of six of the cases relied upon is based upon the war powers or foreign relations powers of the presidency- Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman Steamship Corp. , 333 U.S. 103, 109 , 68 S.Ct. 431 , 92 L.Ed. 568 (1948); United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp. , 299 U.S. 304, 319-320 , 57 S.Ct. 216 , 81 L.Ed. 255 (1936); Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473, A.F.L.-C.I.O.
v. McElroy , 367 U.S. 886, 890 , 81 S.Ct. 1743 , 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961); Oetjen v. Central Leather Co. , 246 U.S. 297 , 38 S.Ct. 309 , 62 L.Ed. 726 (1918); United States v. Pink , 315 U.S. 203 , 62 S.Ct. 552 , 86 L.Ed. 796 (1942); Totten v. United States , 92 U.S. 105 , 23 L.Ed. 605 (1875).
None of these cases are criminal cases.
None of them involve the Fourth Amendment.
None of them involved wiretapping.
These cases we deem totally inapplicable to the instant case where the Attorney General has certified that we deal with a domestic security problem.
Generally concerning presidential power in domestic affairs the government cites two other civil cases.
In re Debs , 158 U.S. 564 , 15 S.Ct. 900 , 39 L.Ed. 1092 (1895); Marbury v. Madison , 1 Cranch (5 U.S.), 137 , 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803).
The Debs case was a petition for writ of habeas corpus.
It dealt with contempt of court sentences meted out by a federal court for violation of an injunction issued during the Pullman Car strike of 1894.
The opinion upheld the jurisdiction of the court which issued the injunction and entered the contempt sentences.
3 The opinion does contain dictum which described broad powers on the part of "the national government" to employ force to "brush away" obstructions to interstate commerce and to the mails.
The instant case has no relation to interstate commerce or the United States mails.
And the Debs case can hardly be read as authority for ignoring judicial processes.
As to Marbury v. Madison , supra , the government's citation seems to us to be questionable from its point of view.
The case does deal with presidential power vis-a-vis the Constitution.
But it is also Chief Justice Marshall's ringing affirmation of the supremacy of the Constitution over all three branches of government and of the authority and obligation of the Supreme Court of the United States to make binding interpretations of that document.
We shall quote from Justice Marshall's language in the last section of this opinion.
As for In re Neagle , 135 U.S. 1 , 10 S.Ct. 658 , 34 L.Ed. 55 (1890), we thank the government for calling to our attention this fascinating story of the problems of the judiciary in an earlier day.
But the holding that the President has a right under Article II, 3 to appoint a Deputy Marshal to protect the threatened life of a Supreme Court Justice is hardly precedent for this case. The government also cites Abel v. United States , 362 U.S. 217 , 80 S.Ct. 683 , 4 L.Ed.2d 668 (1960).
This case involved a prosecution for espionage against the most important foreign spy known to the American public in the Twentieth Century.
He was an alien and, hence, subject to statutory regulations providing for administrative procedures for deportation for violations of the laws and regulations of the United States.
He was arrested by warrant, which the opinion of the Court found to have been lawfully issued by a lawfully authorized magistrate, and the materials seized at the time of his arrest were held legally admissible as incident to that arrest.
Cf. Chimel v. California , 395 U.S. 752 , 89 S.Ct. 2034 , 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969).
Although there were issues in this case which divided the Court 5-4, it cannot appropriately be cited as precedent for seizure without warrant of wiretap materials in domestic security problems.
Finally, the government relies upon the fact that there are certain established exceptions to the requirement of a prior judicial warrant for a search.
See Chambers v. Maroney , 399 U.S. 42 , 90 S.Ct. 1975 , 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970); Terry v. Ohio , 392 U.S. 1 , 88 S.Ct. 1868 , 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); Warden v. Hayden , 387 U.S. 294 , 87 S.Ct. 1642 , 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967); Schmerber v. California , 384 U.S. 757 , 86 S.Ct. 1826 , 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966).
None of these cases, however, were wiretap cases.
All involved emergency situations which were held to prevent obtaining or excuse absence of a prior warrant.
And in all instances there was submission of evidence for subsequent judicial review.
The point at which the claim of broad inherent power of the presidency in domestic affairs actually came to decision is found in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , 343 U.S. 579 , 72 S.Ct. 863 , 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952).
There President Truman's seizure of the steel mills to avoid a nationwide steel strike was defended as within his inherent power as Chief Executive charged with seeing that the laws are "faithfully executed."
The Supreme Court squarely rejected the inherent power doctrine in an opinion by Mr. Justice Black, from which we quote the controlling language: Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer supra at 587-589 72 S.Ct. at 866 The Youngstown case, of course, had nothing to do with wiretaps.
But it is the authoritative case dealing with the inherent powers of the Presidency--a doctrine which is strongly relied upon by the government in this case. THE WIRETAP ISSUE IN THE SUPREME COURT Historically there have been four positions stated on the legality of wiretapping or the admissibility of evidence derived therefrom. 1.
In its first encounter with the problem, the United States Supreme Court simply decided that since there was no trespass involved in the wiretap there concerned, it was therefore not a search and seizure and the Fourth Amendment did not apply to it.
Olmstead v. United States , 277 U.S. 438 , 48 S.Ct. 564 , 72 L.Ed. 944 (1928); Goldman v. United States , 316 U.S. 129 , 62 S.Ct. 993 , 86 L.Ed. 1322 (1942).
2.
In Olmstead Justice Brandeis in dissent (joined by Justice Holmes, who called wiretapping a "dirty business") staked out a position which has many adherents today.
This position is that wiretapping represented an unfair invasion of privacy which the government should not undertake under any circumstance.
3.
The third position, one which the Supreme Court came to gradually, 4 is now the dominant one in our law and best expressed in Katz v. United States , 389 U.S. 347 , 88 S.Ct. 507 , 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967).
The Supreme Court now clearly regards the protection of the Fourth Amendment to be one afforded to the right of privacy rather than to property.
In Katz and its progeny (discussed and cited above) the Supreme Court specifically held that wiretapping which did not invade property rights was nonetheless governed by the restrictions of the Fourth Amendment.
4.
The fourth position is the one just set forth in the preceding section of this opinion wherein the Attorney General and his representatives claim special powers for the presidency and for law enforcement officials acting with the authorization of the Attorney General to wiretap in "national security cases."
The argument for this power is best exemplified by articles by former Attorney General Brownell and former Deputy Attorney General Rogers.
Brownell, The Public Security and Wire Tapping, 39 Cornell L.Q. 195 (1954); Rogers, The Case for Wire Tapping, 63 Yale L.J. 792 (1954).
This position is also explicated in memoranda exchanged between three former Presidents of the United States and their Attorneys General commanding or authorizing them to make greater or lesser use of this asserted Presidential power.
See Appendix A. It appears to us that this fourth position could (and perhaps should) be further subdivided as between foreign and domestic applications.
(Note that the American Bar Association has recently adopted a similar position.
ABA Standards For Electronic Surveillance, 8 Crim.L.Rep.
3097 (Feb. 17, 1971); ABA Delegates Approve Electronic Eavesdropping Standards, Reports and Proposals, 8 Crim.L.Rep.
2371 (Feb. 17, 1971)).
But it is clear that in neither event has the specific power thus asserted ever been the subject of adjudication in the United States Supreme Court.
In fact, in footnote 23 in the Katz case, Mr. Justice Stewart, writing for the Court, expressly reserved decision thereon: "23.
Whether safeguards other than prior authorization by a magistrate would satisfy the Fourth Amendment in a situation involving the national security is a question not presented by this case." Katz v. United States , supra at 358 n. 23, 88 S.Ct. at 515 .
Even more recently in a foreign intelligence wiretap context, the Supreme Court had this issue presented on application for writ of certiorari.
It denied the writ as applied to this issue.
United States v. Clay , 430 F.2d 165 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. granted, limited to question 4, 400 U.S. 990 , 91 S.Ct. 457 , 27 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971).
From what has been said, it is clear that as far as the Appellate Courts are concerned, we write upon a clean slate.
CONGRESSIONAL ACTION The wiretap problem has also been the subject of great concern in the Legislative Branch of government.
Early in the history of the wiretap controversy, and with little debate, Congress enacted 605 , which says in part: 47 U.S.C. 605 Section 605 played some role in the development of the Supreme Court case law.
But its language (forbidding interception and divulgence in describing the offense) failed to establish a decisive policy.
Private wiretappers, many of them criminal, had every interest in not divulging.
And successive Attorneys General took the statute as a license to wiretap so long as their agents did not divulge.
See Brownell, The Public Security and Wire Tapping, 39 Cornell L.Q. 195 (1954); Rogers, The Case for Wire Tapping, 63 Yale L.J. 792 (1954).
The Omnibus Crime Control & Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. 2510 et seq.
(Supp. V, 1965-69), was, however, a very different matter.
It followed the Supreme Court decision in Katz v. United States , supra in point of time.
In many respects it followed Katz in content.
For our purposes the important sections of the bill are those which set out search warrant application procedures, those which allow an emergency exception from those procedures for 48 hours, and those which indicate that Congress was not seeking to restrict whatever constitutional power the President possessed in this field.
"(1) The Attorney General, or any Assistant Attorney General specially designated by the Attorney General, may authorize an application to a Federal judge of competent jurisdiction for, and such judge may grant in conformity with section 2518 of this chapter an order authorizing or approving the interception of wire or oral communications by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a Federal agency having responsibility for the investigation of the offense as to which the application is made, when such interception may provide or has provided evidence of sections 2274 section 186 section 501(c) section 201 section 224 section 1084 section 1503 section 1510 section 1751 section 1951 section 1952 section 1954 section 659 section 664 sections 2314 section 471 sections 892 18 U.S.C. 2516(1) "(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any investigative or law enforcement officer, specially designated by the Attorney General or by the principal prosecuting attorney of any State or subdivision thereof acting pursuant to a statute of that State, who reasonably determines that may intercept such wire or oral communication if an application for an order approving the interception is made in accordance with this section within forty-eight hours after the interception has occurred, or begins to occur.
In the absence of an order, such interception shall immediately terminate when the communication sought is obtained or when the application for the order is denied, whichever is earlier.
In the event such application for approval is denied, or in any other case where the interception is terminated without an order having been issued, the contents of any wire or oral communication intercepted shall be treated as having been obtained in violation of this chapter, and an inventory shall be served as provided for in subsection (d) of this section on the person named in the application."
18 U.S.C. 2518(7) (Supp. V, 1965-69).
"(3) Nothing contained in this chapter or in section 605 of the Communications Act of 1934 ( 48 Stat. 1143 ; 47 U.S.C. 605 ) shall limit the constitutional power of the President to take such measures as he deems necessary to protect the Nation against actual or potential attack or other hostile acts of a foreign power, to obtain foreign intelligence information deemed essential to the security of the United States, or to protect national security information against foreign intelligence activities.
Nor shall anything contained in this chapter be deemed to limit the constitutional power of the President to take such measures as he deems necessary to protect the United States against the overthrow of the Government by force or other unlawful means, or against any other clear and present danger to the structure or existence of the Government.
The contents of any wire or oral communication intercepted by authority of the President in the exercise of the foregoing powers may be received in evidence in any trial hearing, or other proceeding only where such interception was reasonable, and shall not be otherwise used or disclosed except as is necessary to implement that power."
18 U.S.C. 2511 (3) (Supp. V, 1965-69).
Without now passing specifically upon any of the more controversial aspects of this legislation, we view the wiretap provisions of the Omnibus Crime Bill as a general recognition by Congress that the Fourth Amendment does mandate judicial review of proposed searches and seizures of oral communications by wire.
In addition, in 2518(7) (a) Congress provided a statutory remedy for the exact sort of "national Security" problem which is presented by this case.
It is obvious, however, that the Attorney General chose not to employ it.
While the government appears to rely heavily upon 18 U.S.C. 2511(3) , the language chosen by Congress, "Nor shall anything contained in this chapter be deemed to limit the constitutional power of the President *" is not the language used for a grant of power.
On the contrary, it was in our opinion clearly designed to place Congress in a completely neutral position in the very controversy with which this case is concerned.
HOLDING During more difficult times for the Republic than these, Benjamin Franklin said: 5 It is the historic role of the Judiciary to see that in periods of crisis, when the challenge to constitutional freedoms is the greatest, the Constitution of the United States remains the supreme law of our land.
No one proclaimed this message with more force than did one of the first and one of the greatest Chief Justices of the United States.
In Marbury v. Madison , 1 Cranch (5 U.S.) 137 , 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803), Chief Justice Marshall spoke on constitutional supremacy: Marbury v. Madison supra at 176 In the same opinion Chief Justice Marshall outlined the function of the courts in interpreting the Constitution: Marbury v. Madison supra at 177 The government has not pointed to, and we do not find, one written phrase in the Constitution, in the statutory law, or in the case law of the United States, which exempts the President, the Attorney General, or federal law enforcement from the restrictions of the Fourth Amendment in the case at hand.
It is clear to us that Congress in the Omnibus Crime Control & Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. 2510 et seq.
(Supp. V, 1965-69), refrained from attempting to convey to the President any power which he did not already possess.
Essentially, the government rests its case upon the inherent powers of the President as Chief of State to defend the existence of the State.
We have already shown that this very claim was rejected by the Supreme Court in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , 343 U.S. 579 , 72 S.Ct. 863 , 96 L.Ed 1153 (1952), and we shall not repeat its holding here.
An additional difficulty with the inherent power argument in the context of this case is that the Fourth Amendment was adopted in the immediate aftermath of abusive searches and seizures directed against American colonists under the sovereign and inherent powers of King George III.
The United States Constitution was adopted to provide a check upon "sovereign" power.
The creation of three coordinate branches of government by that Constitution was designed to require sharing in the administration of that awesome power.
It is strange, indeed, that in this case the traditional power of sovereigns like King George III should be invoked on behalf of an American President to defeat one of the fundamental freedoms for which the founders of this country overthrew King George's reign.
The argument for unrestricted employment of Presidential power to wiretap is basically an argument in terrorem .
It suggests that constitutional government is too weak to survive in a difficult world and urges worried judges and worried citizens to return to acceptance of the security of "sovereign" power.
We are earnestly urged to believe that the awesome power sought for the Attorney General will always be used with discretion.
Obviously, even in very recent days, as we shall see, this has not always been the case. And the history of English-speaking peoples (to say nothing of others) is replete with answers.
See e. g. , Entick v. Carrington , 19 How.St.Tr.
1029 (1765).
In Marcus v. Search Warrant , 367 U.S. 717 , 81 S.Ct. 1708 , 6 L.Ed.2d 1127 (1961), the opinion for the United States Supreme Court summarized the long history of the English striving for freedom of expression and press and noted: Marcus v. Search Warrant supra at 724 81 S.Ct. at 1712 The Court also pointed out that as early as the 1760's Lord Camden had denounced a "'discretionary power given to messengers to search wherever their suspicions may chance to fall.
If such a power is truly invested in a secretary of state, and he can delegate this power, it certainly may affect the person and property of every man in this kingdom, and is totally subversive of the liberty of the subject.'
Id., 1167 [ Wilkes v. Wood , 19 How.St.Tr.
1153 ]."
Marcus v. Search Warrant , supra at 729 , 81 S.Ct. at 1714 .
The Court's opinion concluded: Id. at 729 81 S.Ct. at 1715 That which has distinguished the United States of America in the history of the world has been its constitutional protection of individual liberty.
It is this which has created the wonderful diversity of this great country and its many and varied opportunities.
It is this which has created Justice Holmes' free marketplace of ideas from which have come our most signal advances in scientific and technological achievement and in social progress.
Beyond doubt the First Amendment is the cornerstone of American freedom.
The Fourth Amendment stands as guardian of the First.
Of course, it should be noted that the Fourth Amendment's judicial review requirements do not prohibit the President from defending the existence of the state.
Nor does the Fourth Amendment require that law enforcement officials be deprived of electronic surveillance.
What the Fourth Amendment does is to establish the method they must follow.
If, as the government asserts, following that method poses security problems (because an indiscrete or corruptible judge or court employee might betray the proposed investigation), then surely the answer is to take steps to refine the method and eliminate the problems.
No one could be in better position to help the courts accomplish this goal than the Attorney General.
If there be a need for increased security in the presentation of certain applications for search warrant in the federal court, these are administrative problems amenable to solution through the Chief Justice of the United States and the United States Judicial Conference and its affiliated judicial organizations.
The inclination of the judiciary to meet the practical problems of enforcement in this area is evidenced in the specific holding of this court and the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Osborn , 350 F.2d 497 (6th Cir. 1965), aff'd, 385 U.S. 323 , 87 S.Ct. 429 , 17 L.Ed.2d 394 (1966), and in the dictum in Katz v. United States , 389 U.S. 347 , 88 S.Ct. 507 , 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), upon which the search warrant terms of the Omnibus Crime Control & Safe Streets Act 2516 were largely based.
Congress clearly conceived situations so delicate that, for example, the Attorney General might seek his warrant for a search from the Chief Judge of the appropriate United States Court of Appeals.
18 U.S.C. 2510 (Supp. V, 1965-69).
So do we.
But what we cannot conceive is that in the midst of the turmoil of the present day, the courts of the United States should suspend an important principle of the Constitution.
The very nature of our government requires us to defend our nation with the tools which a free society has created and proclaimed and which, indeed, are justification for its existence.
We hold that in dealing with the threat of domestic subversion, the Executive Branch of our government, including the Attorney General and the law enforcement agents of the United States, is subject to the limitations of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution when undertaking searches and seizures for oral communications by wire.
We seek to be equally explicit about what we do not decide in this case: 1) We do not decide what the President of the United States can or cannot lawfully do under his constitutional powers as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy to defend this country from attack, espionage or sabotage by forces or agents of a foreign power.
As we have noted, the certificate filed by the Attorney General in this case makes no reference to and claims no reliance upon any such authority.
2) We do not decide whether or not there were facts available to the Attorney General in this case which might have constituted probable cause for issuance of a prior warrant for the wiretaps under 18 U.S.C. 2516 (Supp. V, 1965-69), or a subsequent warrant (within 48 hours) as provided for by 18 U.S.C. 2518(7) (Supp. V, 1965-69).
This record indicates plainly that no such applications were made.
Indeed, this record is devoid of any showing that any presentation of information under oath was ever made before, or any probable cause findings were ever entered by any administrative official--let alone any judge.
In our view, the Clay case ( United States v. Clay , 430 F.2d 165 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. granted, limited to question 4, 400 U.S. 990 , 91 S.Ct. 457 , 27 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971)) cannot appropriately be read as authority for warrantless wiretaps in domestic security cases.
In that case the government did not contest the illegality of four separate domestic wiretaps made under the same inherent powers relied on in this case. The transcripts of defendant Clay's intercepted conversations were turned over to him by the Department of Justice.
In one such instance the illegal wiretap was upon the telephone of the Rev.
Martin Luther King, Jr.
One wonders, if the inherent powers of the Presidency were broad enough to authorize the wiretaps in the first instance, how these wiretaps became concededly unconstitutional in court.
As to the "fifth" wiretap disclosed in the Clay case, the Attorney General's certificate said that it was "for the purpose of gathering foreign intelligence information."
The Fifth Circuit did squarely hold that such foreign intelligence surveillance without judicial warrant was not a constitutional violation.
This was the second issue on which certiorari was sought from the Supreme Court, but, as we have noted, the Supreme Court refused certiorari on this issue while granting certiorari on another unrelated matter.
In the case before us, however, the Attorney General's certificate makes clear that the wiretaps involved were thought to be warranted by domestic security problems.
We have noted the special constitutional powers of the Presidency in foreign affairs which the Fifth Circuit thought justified his "gathering foreign intelligence information" without judicial warrant.
Without passing on that issue, we reiterate that we have found no such specific constitutional authority to disregard the Fourth Amendment in domestic security cases like this one.
The last issue argued (this one by the government) concerns the order of disclosure of the overheard conversations.
In effect the government contends that even though the District Judge found the interceptions to have been illegal, he should have determined in camera that they were not relevant to this case, and hence, not subject to disclosure.
This very issue has been recently decided by the United States Supreme Court in Alderman v. United States , 394 U.S. 165 , 89 S.Ct. 961 , 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969).
In this case the opinion of the Court said: in camera Alderman v. United States supra at 182-183 89 S.Ct. at 971 In a subsequent but closely related case, the Supreme Court applied Alderman as giving the District Court in camera the right and duty to screen government files for the illegally intercepted conversations of a defendant and held unanimously: Taglianetti v. United States 394 U.S. 316, 317 89 S.Ct. 1099, 1101 22 L.Ed.2d 302 Thus the Supreme Court held that all illegally intercepted conversations of a defendant must be made available to him, but that the District Judge may in camera ascertain which transcripts are covered by this ruling.
Of course, in this case we have no problem concerning standing.
The government concedes that Plamondon's own voice was intercepted and recorded and the District Judge and this court have held the interception to have been illegal.
We cannot agree with the dissent that Justice Stewart's concurring opinion in Giordano v. United States , 394 U.S. 310, 313-315 , 89 S.Ct. 1163 , 22 L.Ed.2d 297 (1969), in any way weakened the disclosure requirement of Alderman .
The full text of Justice Stewart's opinion makes it clear that the "preliminary determination" with which he was concerned was whether or not "any of the surveillances did violate the Fourth Amendment."
This determination Justice Stewart held could be made by in camera inspection--as has been done in this case both by the District Judge and this court.
We believe that the Supreme Court has held that a defendant whose personal conversations have been illegally recorded is entitled to transcripts of the illegally recorded material without regard to whether a judge on inspection in camera might or might not be able to find relevancy.
Nonetheless, we have considered remand of this case to the District Judge for an expression on the relevancy issue so as to have a complete appellate record.
On inspection of the sealed exhibit in this case, however, we cannot (and we do not believe the District Judge could) ascertain with any certainty whether or not the government had derived prosecutorial benefits from this illegal search to which benefits defendant would have the right to object at trial under the doctrine of the "fruit of the poisonous tree."
Nardone v. United States , 308 U.S. 338, 341 , 60 S.Ct. 266 , 84 L.Ed. 307 (1939); Wong Sun v. United States , 371 U.S. 471 , 83 S.Ct. 407 , 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963).
The dissent in this case makes this comment upon the sealed exhibit: subsequent after If this paragraph be read as carefully as it has been written, we have no reason to disagree.
With all respect, however, we think two other facts need to be added before conclusions are drawn.
First, the illegal interceptions occurred well before the indictments in this case were returned, and thus they could have been employed in the investigation which led to the indictments.
Second, we have no way of knowing whether or not the government's investigation was materially aided by associations or leads developed from these conversations, regardless of whether or not the statement providing the lead appears on its face to be "admissible at the trial."
These considerations, of course, primarily affect this trial.
Far more important, however, is the fact that disclosure may well prove to be the only effective protection against illegal wiretapping available to defend the Fourth Amendment rights of the American public.
For these reasons, we hold that the District Judge properly found that the conversations of defendant Plamondon were illegally intercepted, and we cannot hold that his disclosure order (as interpreted below) is an abuse of judicial discretion.
In perhaps an excess of caution, we note that we read the District Judge's disclosure order as limited solely to the transcripts and dates of defendant Plamondon's illegally intercepted telephone conversations.
