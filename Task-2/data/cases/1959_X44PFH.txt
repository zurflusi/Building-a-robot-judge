 PER CURIAM.
After our decision in Helms v. Duckworth , 1957, 101 U.S.App.D.C.
390 , 249 F.2d 482 , 1 the case went back for trial.
The District Court, sitting as a court of equity, heard evidence adduced by both parties, and rendered judgment for the plaintiffs.
The defendant appeals.
We think that the trial court correctly interpreted our decision in the earlier appeal, and that no error occurred affecting substantial rights.
Affirmed.
