 MEDINA , Circuit Judge.
District 65, Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, AFL-CIO appeals from an order of the District Court for the Southern District of New York denying its motion to compel arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement.
The opinion below is reported at 203 F.Supp.
171 .
Beginning in 1949 the Union entered into collective bargaining agreements with Interscience Publishers, Inc., the last one dated February 1, 1960, for a term of two years ending January 31, 1962.
None of these agreements was stated in terms to be binding on Interscience "and its successors."
On October 2, 1961 Interscience effected a consolidation for bona fide business reasons with another publishing firm, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. A dispute arose with respect to the effect of the consolidation on the status of the collective bargaining contract and the Union.
Interscience before the consolidation, and Wiley thereafter took the position that the agreement was automatically terminated for all purposes by the consolidation, and that all rights of the Union and the employees arising out of the agreement were at an end.
The Union adhered throughout the discussions and correspondence both before and after the consolidation to the view that the agreement was not terminated by the consolidation and that certain rights had become "vested" which Wiley must recognize.
The details of this controversy will be more fully described shortly.
The upshot was that the Union demanded arbitration of the dispute, under Article XVI of the Agreement (set forth in full in the Appendix to this opinion), relating to "Grievances: Adjustment of Disputes: Arbitration," and on January 23, 1962, the Union commenced this action against Wiley to compel arbitration.
The District Court assumed that the agreement survived the consolidation, but denied arbitration on two grounds: that the agreement should be so construed as "to exclude from arbitration matters involving the entire collective bargaining unit, as distinguished from the individuals comprising it"; and that, even if not so limited, the Union has failed to avail itself of the grievance procedure described in the agreement and had thus abandoned any rights it might have had to arbitration of the dispute.
We think it clear that the District Court had jurisdiction of the case under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 185 , and that the appeal by the Union is properly before us.
Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills , 1957, 353 U.S. 448 , 77 S.Ct. 912 , 1 L.Ed.2d 972 ; General Electric Co. v. Local 205, United Electrical Workers , 1957, 353 U.S. 547 , 77 S.Ct. 921 , 1 L.Ed.2d 1028 ; Goodall-Sanford, Inc. v. United Textile Workers, AFL Local 1802 , 1957, 353 U.S. 550 , 77 S.Ct. 920 , 1 L.Ed.2d 1031 .
We also hold, as matter of federal law, (1) that the agreement and rights arising therefrom were not necessarily terminated by the consolidation, and that Wiley and the Union are proper parties to the arbitration proceeding; (2) that the terms of the agreement contemplated the arbitration of just such a dispute or controversy as the one before us and that the attempt to arbitrate here is not an improper effort to secure status as collective bargaining agent for the negotiation of a new contract, nor is it an attempt to secure allegedly proscribed "quasi-legislative" arbitration; (3) that issues raised by Wiley arising out of the Union's alleged failure to comply with certain requirements of the agreement relative to so-called grievance procedure are matters to be decided by the arbitrator.
The facts, sketched above, may be stated more fully as follows: On October 2, 1961 Interscience employed 80 persons, of whom 40 were covered by the 1960 contract; Wiley employed 300 persons.
Interscience, with a single plant in New York City, did an annual business of $1,000,000; Wiley, an older company, had three substantially larger plants, and did an annual business of $9,000,000.
The Union learned of the proposed consolidation in June of 1961 and on June 27 wrote Interscience, stating its position that the contract would remain in force notwithstanding the consolidation.
On September 19, 1961 Interscience initiated conversations with the Union, in the course of which Interscience insisted that the contract would end upon consolidation.
On September 21, 1961 Interscience wrote its employees, stating its views on termination and offering jobs at the Wiley plant in New York City.
On October 2, 1961, the effective date of the consolidation, Wiley wrote the Union stating that the contract was terminated.
All of Interscience's 80 employees were subsequently employed by Wiley, but 11 later resigned and received severance pay voluntarily granted by Wiley.
The Union does not allege discrimination against these persons, but attributes their resignation to worsened working conditions.
Wiley has placed the Interscience employees under its own pension plan, crediting them for past service with Interscience, but it does not recognize their seniority or other rights under the Interscience contract, nor does it recognize the appellant Union or any other union.
The Interscience contract obliged Interscience to make quarterly payments into an employee pension fund.
The Union contends that Interscience's payment for the third quarter of 1961 was inadequate, and that Wiley is obliged and has failed to make up this deficit and also to make the payment due for the fourth quarter.
The total claim amounts to $8,000.
The contract also contains provisions according to the Interscience employees rights regarding seniority, job security, grievance procedure, and vacation and severance pay.
On January 23, 1962 the Union commenced this action in the District Court to compel Wiley to arbitrate the dispute between the parties concerning the effect of the consolidation upon the contract and the so-called "vested" rights of the Union and the employees to continued payments by Wiley to the Interscience employee pension fund and to seniority, job security, grievance procedure, and vacation and severance pay, "now and after January 30, 1962."
I The question of "substantive arbitrability" is for the court not for the arbitrator to decide.

The controlling law is not New York law but federal law.

The sources of that law, to be fashioned by judicial inventiveness, are the express provisions of the national labor laws, the basic policies underlying these laws, "state law, if compatible with the purpose of Section 301" and which "will best effectuate the federal policy," and accepted principles of traditional contract law.

See Jay, Arbitration and the Federal Common Law of Collective Bargaining Agreements, 37 N.Y.U.L.Rev.
448 (May, 1962); Comment, The Emergent Federal Common Law of Labor Contracts: A Survey of The Law under Section 301, 28 Univ.Chi.L.Rev.
707 (1961).
The Union tells us that under Section 90 of the New York Stock Corporation Law, McKinney's Consol.Laws, c. 59, 1 the contract did not automatically terminate because the provisions of this statute are to the effect that the consolidated corporation is "deemed to have assumed" and "shall be liable" for "all liabilities and obligations" of the constituent corporation just as if it "had itself incurred such liabilities or obligations."
But this legislation is clearly not binding upon us, and we may or may not find that the rule thus formulated, with or without qualifications or in some modified form, "will best effectuate the federal policy."
We have found no case formulating a rule of federal law on the point at issue here, and none has been called to our attention.
We must accordingly, to the best of our competence, and giving due weight to the legislation of the Congress in the area of labor-management relations and other sources relevant to the task, including the provisions of Section 90 of the New York Stock Corporation Law, fashion for the first time the rule of federal law that is to govern the decision of the first and preliminary question presented for our consideration: Did the consolidation abruptly terminate the collective bargaining agreement and the rights of the Union and the employees created or arising thereunder?
We think it clear and we decide and hold that the federal policy of promoting industrial peace and stability, especially with reference to arbitration procedures set up in collective bargaining agreements ( Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills , supra, 353 U.S. at 453-454 , 77 S.Ct. 914 , 1 L.Ed.2d 972 ; United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior & Gulf Navigation Co. , 1960, 363 U.S. 574, 578 , 80 S.Ct. 1347 , 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 ; Local 174, Teamsters, etc. v. Lucas Flour Co. , supra, 369 U.S. at 105 , 82 S.Ct. 571 , 7 L.Ed. 593 ; Drake Bakeries Inc. v. Local 50 , 1962, 370 U.S. 254, 263 , 82 S.Ct. 1346 , 8 L.Ed.2d 474 ) can be fostered and sustained only by answering this question in the negative.
And we reach this conclusion despite the fact that the agreement contains no statement that its terms are to be binding upon Interscience "and its successors," and the further fact that neither of the parties had a possible consolidation in mind when the terms of the agreement were negotiated and settled.
Not only would a contrary rule involve manifest injustice, a circumstance not to be lightly disregarded or brushed aside; it would be a breeder of discontent and unharmonious relations between employer and employees, and a source of unnecessary and disrupting litigation.
A further principle, particularly applicable in the formulation of new segments of federal labor law, is, we think, the principle of restraint that requires us to formulate the rule that is decisive of the case before us, and to go no further.
Thus, while we do hold that the consolidation did not ipso facto terminate all rights of the Union and the employees created by or arising out of the collective bargaining agreement, 2 we do not decide what those rights are.
As will appear in a later portion of this opinion, the power and function of making a decision, or a series of decisions, with respect to these rights, have been reserved by the parties for the arbitrator in the course of the arbitration proceedings that will follow our reversal of the order appealed from.
Cf. Goodall-Sanford, Inc. v. United Textile Workers, AFL Local 1802 , 1 Cir., 1956, 233 F.2d 104, 110 , affirmed, 1957, 353 U.S. 550 , 77 S.Ct. 920 , 1 L.Ed.2d 1031 .
Our decision, then, cannot be construed as holding generally that collective bargaining agreements survive consolidation.
We merely hold that, as we interpret the collective bargaining agreement before us in the light of Supreme Court decisions enunciating the federal policy of promoting industrial peace and stability, especially with reference to arbitration procedures set up in collective bargaining agreements, we cannot say that it was intended that this consolidation should preclude this Union from proceeding to arbitration to determine the effect of the consolidation on the contract and on the rights of the employees arising under the contract.
Several additional objections to arbitration have been made on the ground of improper parties.
Wiley contends that it cannot be made a party to the arbitration proceeding because it was not a party to the agreement and the arbitration clause was not binding upon it.
We think that our discussion above disposes of this objection as well.
When negotiating and before effectuating the consolidation of October 2, 1961, Wiley was aware of the existence of the collective bargaining agreement and of its obligations under the New York Stock Corporation Law, Section 90.
In view of the national policy of promoting industrial peace and stability and the special function of arbitration in promoting these ends, above adverted to, we think and hold, in the exercise of our duty to fashion an appropriate rule of federal labor law, that it is not too much to expect and require that this employer proceed to arbitration with the representatives of the Union to determine whether the obligation to arbitrate regarding the substantive terms of the contract survived the consolidation on October 2, 1961, and, if so, just what employee rights, if any, survived the consolidation.
3 Wiley also argues that the Union is not the proper party to present the claims of these employees.
But the fact that the contract has now terminated does not of itself bar arbitration.
United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp, , 1960, 363 U.S. 593 , 80 S.Ct. 1358 , 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 .
There is no showing that the Union here has been decertified.
Glendale Mfg. Co. v. Local 520, etc.
Garment Workers , 4 Cir., 1960, 283 F.2d 936 , cert. denied, 1961, 366 U.S. 950 , 81 S.Ct. 1902 , 6 L.Ed.2d 1243 ; Modine Mfg. Co. v. Grand Lodge, etc.
Machinists , 6 Cir., 1954, 216 F.2d 326 .
There is here no rival union, whose rights would be interfered with by the Union's pressing of these employee claims.
Kenin v. Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. , S.D.N.Y., 1960, 188 F.Supp.
690 .
In short, there is no showing that the freedom of choice of any employee would in any way be infringed by the Union's pressing of the employee claims under a preexisting agreement, and we are aware of no reason why the Union may not enforce arbitration of a dispute or controversy concerning rights alleged to have arisen out of and pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement which it negotiated, especially where there appears to be no other person or entity in a position legally to enforce arbitration.
II The issues tendered by the Union for arbitration are: In its brief and on oral argument the Union characterized the rights claimed by it on behalf of itself and the employees it represents as "property rights" or "vested rights" built up by the employees "during their long years of employment" in accordance with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.
4 Hence the essence of the proposed submission is that the arbitrator determine the nature of and proper remedy for implementing those rights, if any, as to seniority, pension plan, job security, grievance procedure, and vacation and severance pay, which he finds accrued during the term of the collective bargaining agreement.
In other words, implicit in the submission is the possibility that the arbitrator may decide that no rights to seniority, pension plan, job security, grievance procedure, or vacation and severance pay, survived the consolidation or the date of expiration of the collective bargaining agreement.
It is not our function to express any opinion on the subject, provided the agreement contemplates that such a question or congeries of questions was to be decided by arbitration.
United Steelworkers of America v. American Mfg. Co. , 1960, 363 U.S. 564, 567-569 , 80 S.Ct. 1343 , 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 .
5 We may note that it is just because the Union seeks to arbitrate the existence and nature of rights which it claims "vested" during the term of the agreement, although maturing after the termination thereof, that arbitration here does not conflict with the rule above discussed, that a successor employer will not be required to continue to bargain with a union when there has been a substantial change in the nature of the employment enterprise.
So too, it is because of this claim of "vested rights" that our order of arbitration does not conflict with decisions, whose validity we need not pass upon, barring "quasi-legislative" arbitration.
See Boston Printing Pressman's Union v. Potter Press , D.Mass.
1956, 141 F.Supp.
553 , affirmed, 1 Cir., 1957, 241 F.2d 787 , cert. denied, 355 U.S. 817 , 78 S.Ct. 21 , 2 L.Ed.2d 34 ; Couch v. Prescolite Mfg. Corp. , W.D.Ark., 1961, 191 F.Supp.
737 ; In re Valencia Baxt Express, Inc. , D.P.R., 1961, 199 F.Supp.
103 .
A careful scrutiny of the agreement discloses, we think, a perfectly clear intention that the questions propounded by the Union be arbitrated.
A distinction is made, on the very face of the agreement, between ordinary grievances personal to individual employees, on the one hand, and other, perhaps more important disputes, such as the one before us, relative to "matters affecting the entire bargaining unit," both of which, however, are subjected to arbitration.
Read as a whole the agreement clearly contemplates the arbitration of any "difference" or "dispute" between the Union and the employer "arising out of or relating to this agreement, or its interpretation or application, or enforcement."
Arbitration is not limited to "grievances."
This language, quoted from Section 16.0 of Article XVI, relating to "Grievances: Adjustments of Disputes: Arbitration," is plainly intended to be broad and comprehensive.
And we must remember the teaching of United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior & Gulf Navigation Co. , supra, 363 U.S. at 584-585 , 80 S.Ct. 1347 , 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 , that the dispute is to be arbitrated unless it is perfectly clear that it is specifically and plainly excluded.
The party claiming exclusion has a heavy burden.
See Procter & Gamble Independent Union, etc. v. Procter & Gamble Mfg. Co. , 2 Cir., 1962, 298 F.2d 644 .
The exclusion clause relied upon here is Section 16.5(3) referring to "matters not covered by this agreement."
Wiley would have us hold that, because the agreement does not mention the possibility of consolidation, the "matter" in suit is not covered by the agreement.
This is pure sophistry.
This suit involves the Union's claim of rights to pension plan, seniority, vacation and severance pay and other matters that are covered by specific provisions of the agreement, and even if such claim is wrong or even untenable and frivolous, this does not bar arbitration.
United Steelworkers of America v. American Mfg. Co. , supra, 363 U.S. at 568-569 , 80 S.Ct. 1343 , 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 .
Moreover, the various specific references to matters reserved for the sole control of the employer and resting in his discretion, contained elsewhere in the agreement, merely emphasize the fact that no such specific exclusionary clauses make reference to any privilege on the part of the employer to consolidate with another company and cut off rights allegedly "vested" in the employees, such as the right to payments to the welfare fund, to vacations, and to seniority.
It is not probable that the Union would have agreed to any such exclusionary clause had the subject come up for discussion.
A further argument in support of the interpretation of the agreement given above is that as arbitration is described as "the sole and exclusive" remedy of the parties and the employees, "in lieu of any and all remedies, forums at law, in equity or otherwise," "for any claimed violations of this contract, and for any and all acts or omissions claimed to have been committed by either party during the term of this agreement" (Section 16.9), it is not reasonable to suppose that it was intended that the Union should have no right whatever to resort to arbitration in the event of a consolidation, but should be entirely at the mercy of the employer.
III While the Supreme Court has clearly held that the question of "substantive arbitrability" is for the court ( Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining Co. , supra, 370 U.S. at 241 , 82 S.Ct. 1318 , 8 L.Ed.2d 462 ), it has never expressly decided the question as to "procedural arbitrability," namely, whether or not adherence or lack of adherence to the grievance and arbitration procedure outlined in a collective bargaining agreement is for decision by the court or by the arbitrator.
Nor do we discern such a ruling by implication in the fact, adverted to by Wiley, that one week after deciding the Steelworkers cases the Court denied certiorari in Brass & Copper Workers, etc. v. American Brass Co. , 7 Cir., 1959, 272 F.2d 849 , cert. denied, 1960, 363 U.S. 845 , 80 S.Ct. 1609 , 4 L.Ed.2d 1728 , a case in which the Seventh Circuit had held that the question is for the court.
So far as other authority is concerned, this Circuit has never spoken clearly on the issue, and there appears to be a difference of opinion on this point in the other Circuits, with more recent decisions holding that the question is for the arbitrator.
6 The lower federal courts seem also to be split, 7 and the commentators in general agree that the matter is for the arbitrator.
8 This question of "procedural arbitrability" is squarely before us now.
By way of preliminary we must, we think, take note of the fact that "substantive arbitrability" and "procedural arbitrability" are separate and distinct matters.
The Supreme Court has explained the rule that "substantive arbitrability" is for the court in the following terms: 301 United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior & Gulf Co. , supra, 363 U.S. at 582 , 80 S.Ct 1347 , 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 ; Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining Co. , supra, 370 U.S. at 241 , 82 S.Ct. 1318 , 8 L.Ed.2d 462 .
However, as Professor Cox has correctly noted in his article in 72 Harvard Law Review, supra at 1511, "the reason for giving the court power to decide what subject matter is within the arbitration clause does not extend" to the issue of "procedural arbitrability," for the court's duty to determine "whether the reluctant party has breached his promise to arbitrate" is exhausted once it has been determined that "the party seeking arbitration is making a claim which on its face is governed by the contract" or that "the reluctant party did agree to arbitrate the grievance or did agree to give the arbitrator power to make the award he made."
United Steelworkers of America v. American Mfg. Co. , supra, 363 U.S. at 568 , 80 S.Ct. 1343 , 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 ; United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior & Gulf Navigation Co. , supra, 363 U.S. at 582 , 80 S.Ct. 1347 , 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 .
See Philadelphia Dress Joint Board, etc. v. Sidele Fashions, Inc. , E.D.Pa., 1960, 187 F.Supp.
97, 100 .
Thus the settled law on the issue of "substantive arbitrability" does not control the decision of the separate problem now under discussion, and we think there is ample reason for holding that issues of compliance with grievance and arbitration procedure in the ordinary collective bargaining agreement are properly within the competence of the arbitrator.
We find wholly unpersuasive the argument that questions of procedure in collective bargaining agreements involve "largely a matter of contract construction" as to which "the industrial context is irrelevant" and that consequently "the courts' expertise in construing agreements seems to qualify them as the appropriate forum for determining procedural compliance."
28 Univ.Chi.L.Rev., supra at 732.
Rather we believe that a holding that this Court or any court should decide the merits of a dispute concerning procedural questions under an arbitration clause of a collective bargaining agreement would be quite inconsistent with the principles and policies enunciated by the Supreme Court to the effect that once it has been determined that the reluctant party has breached his promise to arbitrate, the matter must go to the arbitrator for determination on the merits.
United Steelworkers of America v. American Mfg. Co. , supra, 363 U.S. at 568 , 80 S.Ct. 1343 , 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 ; United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior & Gulf Co. , supra, 363 U.S. at 581-582 , 80 S.Ct. 1347 , 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 ; United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp. , supra, 363 U.S. at 596 , 80 S.Ct. 1358 , 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 .
What is fundamental to the teaching of these cases, as we read them, is the ruling that the parties have bargained for a decision by an arbitrator because they thus have the benefit of his creativity and expertise that are in no small measure due to his knowledge of and familiarity with the industry and shop practices constituting the environment in which the terms of collective bargaining agreement were negotiated and assented to.
Surely, and especially under the conditions of the industrial world of today, this environment, and the concrete day-by-day relationships to which the agreement must be applied, includes the implementation of the arbitration clause and its procedural aspects.
See Procedural Requirements of a Grievance Arbitration Clause: Another Question of Arbitrability, 70 Yale L.J. 611, 618 (1961); Cox, Reflections upon Labor Arbitration, 72 Harv.L.Rev.

635, 646-9 (1959).

221.
Indeed, it may well be that the arbitrator can make his most important contribution to industrial peace by a fair, impartial and well-informed decision of these very procedural matters.
To hold matters of procedure to be beyond the competence of the arbitrator to decide, would, we think, rob the parties of the advantages they have bargained for, that is to say, the determination of the issues between them by an arbitrator and not by a court.
A contrary decision would emasculate the arbitration provisions of the contract.
The position just above outlined seems to us to be the only sound position to take, especially when we consider what are the particular procedural questions involved in this case.
Accordingly, we shall summarize, as briefly as we can, the miscellaneous contentions of Wiley that are supposed to fall in the category of procedure and the way these contentions are dealt with by the Union.
Thus Wiley claims the Union was required to follow Steps 1, 2 and 3, described in Section 16.0.
The Union replies that these applied only to an "affected employee," and not to the controversy in this case which affects the entire bargaining unit.
The Union also points to the fact that there was an orderly exchange of views, and says this surely was a substantial compliance with the contract.
Cf.
International Association of Machinists v. Hayes Corp. , 5 Cir., 1961, 296 F.2d 238 .
With respect to Wiley's claim that there was a failure to comply with the requirement of Section 16.6 that "any grievance must be filed with the Employer and with the Union Shop Steward within four (4) weeks after its occurrence or latest existence," the Union replies that the question here is not a "grievance" but a "dispute" or "difference" arising out of the agreement and that this Section has no application to a dispute over such a broad question as to whether all the employees had "vested" rights under the contract inextinguishable by unilateral action by the employer; and that to say this is a "grievance" to be filed "with the Employer and with the Union Shop Steward" borders on absurdity.
Moreover, the Union contends that, if some sort of notice of the dispute was required within four weeks after its "occurrence or latest existence," the letter of June 27, 1961, filed within four weeks after the Union learned of the proposed consolidation, was such notice.
It is further argued by the Union that the dispute was plainly a continuing one.
But the Union adds that even if all its contentions as above stated were to be rejected, there was a clear waiver of procedural requirements by Wiley.
Is it to be supposed that the benefits of arbitration, duly bargained for, are to be indefinitely postponed, just because one of the parties tenders a miscellany of such contentions as these, and argues that no arbitration can be had until after a court has rejected them and they have also been passed upon by this Court?
It is of the essence of arbitration that it be speedy and that the source of friction between the parties be promptly eliminated.
Robert Lawrence Co. v. Devonshire Fabrics, Inc. , 2 Cir., 1959, 271 F.2d 402, 410 , cert. granted, 1960, 362 U.S. 909 , 80 S.Ct. 682 , 4 L.Ed.2d 618 , dismissed per stipulation, 364 U.S. 801 , 81 S.Ct. 27 , 5 L.Ed.2d 37 .
The numerous cases involving a great variety of procedural niceties already cited in the footnotes to this opinion make it abundantly clear that, were we to decide that procedural questions under an arbitration clause of a collective bargaining agreement are for the court, we would open the door wide to all sorts of technical obstructionism.
This would be completely at odds with the "basic policy of national labor legislation to promote the arbitral process as a substitute for economic warfare."

Cf. Procter & Gamble Independent Union, etc. v. Procter & Gamble Mfg. Co. , supra, 298 F.2d at 645 .
It is for this reason that we cannot agree to the distinction propounded by Judge Palmieri in his very excellent discussion in Carey v. General Electric Co., S.D.N.Y., 1962, 50 L.R.R.M.
2119, 45 CCH Lab. Cas. ¶ 17,599, between matters of procedural compliance requiring the expertise of the arbitrator for decision and those which the courts are capable of deciding on their own.
If the court must first decide whether a particular procedural problem calls for the special abilities and knowledge of an arbitrator, there will be inevitable delay.
Such a practice, if followed, would develop a whole new body of decisional law, with the usual distinctions and refinements.
Moreover, we have serious doubts that the suggested distinction between different types of procedural questions arising out of the arbitration clauses in collective bargaining agreements can be placed upon any tenable and rational basis.
In any event, it is clear that the practical consequences of attempts by the courts to apply such a distinction would be delay and prejudice to the speedy and effective arbitration which we believe the national policy calls for.
Having thus decided that the question of "procedural arbitrability" is for the arbitrator, we do not reach the merits of Wiley's contentions that the Union did not comply with the procedural requirements of the collective bargaining agreement.
Reversed with a direction to order arbitration.
