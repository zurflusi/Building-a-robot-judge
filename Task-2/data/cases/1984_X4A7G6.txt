 GEORGE CLIFTON EDWARDS, Jr.
, Circuit Judge.
This is a school case tangentially involving segregation in public schools--this concerning a formula for layoff of teachers of minority races during economically required reductions in staff.
The disputed formula is contained in the collective bargaining contract executed between the Jackson Teachers Association and the Board of Education of the City of Jackson, Michigan.
It reads as follows: except that at no time will there be a greater percentage of minority personnel laid off than the current percentage of minority personnel employed at the time of the layoff Appellants, who object to the Board's following this provision, contend that the quoted provision violates both federal and state statutory and constitutional provisions, including particularly the fourteenth amendment, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e to 2000e-17 (1976 & Supp. V 1981); 42 U.S.C. 1981 , 1983 and 1985 (1976 & Supp. V 1981).
While, at oral argument, this court was advised that due to somewhat improved economic conditions, only one teacher assignment is as a practical matter currently involved, the fundamental dispute over the validity of Art.
XII.B.1.
is still before us.
The District Judge who heard this case wrote a careful opinion upholding the validity of the layoff system adopted by the School Board and the Federation of Teachers.
We quote in part Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education , 546 F.Supp.
1195 (E.D.Mich.1982) as follows: "Plaintiffs argue first that they are entitled to summary judgment because an employer and a union cannot lawfully negotiate a voluntary affirmative action plan which gives preferential treatment to minorities, where there has been no judicial finding of past employer discrimination.
Stated in other words, plaintiffs argue that societal discrimination, as opposed to identifiable employer discrimination, is not a lawful basis for the adoption of a voluntary affirmative action plan. "
United Steelworkers of America v. Weber , 443 U.S. 193 , 99 S.Ct. 2721 , 61 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979) held that Title VII does not prohibit a private employer from voluntarily adopting an affirmative action plan 'to eliminate conspicuous racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories.'
443 U.S. at 209 , 99 S.Ct. at 2730 .
In Weber , there was no judicial finding that the private employer, Kaiser Aluminum, had ever engaged in race discrimination.
However, Kaiser's work force statistics for the years prior to the adoption of the affirmative action plan pointed up gross disparities between the number of blacks employed by Kaiser and the number of blacks in the relevant labor market.
Thus, Weber stands for the proposition that Title VII does not require a judicial finding of employer discrimination before a private sector employer may adopt an affirmative action plan. "
Detroit Police Officers' Association v. Young , 608 F.2d 671 (6th Cir.1979), cert. denied , 452 U.S. 938 , 101 S.Ct. 3079 , 69 L.Ed.2d 951 (1981), extended this particular holding of Weber to public sector employers and to alleged Constitutional violations.
"In Young , the Detroit Police Department, after an internal determination that blacks were underrepresented in the department, voluntarily adopted an affirmative action program which promoted black patrolmen to sergeant ahead of white patrolmen who were higher on the eligibility list.
The white officers challenged the affirmative promotion plan on Title VII and Equal Protection grounds.
The Sixth Circuit relied on Weber to hold that the internal determination of racial disparities justified the voluntary plan, even though there had been no prior judicial determination of race discrimination.
