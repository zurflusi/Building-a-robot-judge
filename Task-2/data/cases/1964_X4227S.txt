 RIVES , Circuit Judge.
These actions, involving common questions of law and fact, were consolidated in the district court and decided pursuant to an opinion reported at 200 F.Supp.
468 .
They involve rights asserted separately by Patrick A. McKenna and Pan American Petroleum Corporation in an oil and gas lease from the United States to Floyd A. Wallis covering 826.87 acres of exceedingly rich "mud lumps" at the mouth of the Mississippi River in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana.
The lease was issued to Wallis on December 19, 1958, effective January 1, 1959.
The lease was of public domain land, that is land in which title vested in the United States because of its sovereignty pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, now appearing as Title 30 U.S.C.A. 181 et seq., as distinguished from acquired land, that is land which was once privately owned and then acquired by the United States, the leasing of which is pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of August 7, 1947, now appearing as Title 30 U.S. C.A. 351 et seq.
The claims both of McKenna and of Pan American were based upon events occurring prior to the issuance of the lease to Wallis.
McKenna claimed that Wallis and he were joint venturers in acquiring the lease, and that he was entitled to an undivided one-third interest in the lease.
Pan American claimed that Wallis had entered into an agreement granting Pan American the option to acquire the lease thereafter issued to Wallis.
The district court decided that neither McKenna nor Pan American acquired any interest in the lease upon what the court referred to as a very narrow issue, saying: R.S.

468, 471, 472 .
We think that the district court committed fundamental error in applying Louisiana statutes and law to determine rights in a lease on public domain land which were and are subject only to the sovereignty of the United States.
The principle as to which law, state or federal, applies was stated long ago in Wilcox v. Jackson ex dem.
McConnel , 1839, 38 U.S. (13 Peters) 498, 516 , 10 L.Ed. 264 : Subsequent decisions have made it clear that "title" as used in that principle includes not only the legal title, but also the equitable title, indeed, the entire bundle of rights going to make up ownership.
Whether the lease from the United States to Wallis was in part for the benefit of McKenna or of Pan American or of both are questions to be determined by federal law.
Irvine v. Marshall, et al.
, 1858, 61 U.S. (20 How.) 558 , 15 L.Ed. 994 , requires the application of federal law until both legal and equitable titles have passed from the United States.
The United States was not a party to that litigation, but the Court recognized in clear and unmistakable terms that the United States owed a duty, to be performed both through its General Land Office and through its federal courts, to see that the equitable title as well as the legal title to public lands was vested in the proper person who proved his right under the federal law.
The opinion emphasized the doctrine of resulting trusts which may have application to the facts of this case: Massie v. Watts 6th vol. of Cranch, p. 143 [148 3 L.Ed. 181 pp.

149 5 L.Ed. 414 The Mineral Leasing Act itself makes clear that, as a part of the public policy of the United States directed at opposing the monopoly of federally-owned mineral deposits, the Bureau of Land Management must examine into the qualifications of the real lessee and of any assignee of a mineral lease or of a part interest.
See sections 181 and 184 of 30 U.S.C.A. Those provisions leave no room for operation of any State law.
The same result must be reached if we follow through on the logical views expressed by the Director of the Bureau of Land Management of the United States Department of Interior in his decision sustaining Wallis' application to lease as public domain land the acreage here involved: What Law Then is to Control?

Vacated and remanded.
