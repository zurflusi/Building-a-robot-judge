 BARKSDALE , Circuit Judge: Myra Jo Collins appeals the Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissal of her 1983 action, which alleges that the failure of the City of Harker Heights, Texas, to adequately train its employees was a policy of deliberate indifference to her deceased husband's constitutional rights.
Pursuant to controlling Fifth Circuit precedent, because an abuse of government power is not implicated, a 1983 action does not lie.
Accordingly, we AFFIRM.
I. According to Collins' complaint, her husband began working in July 1988, for the City in its sanitation and sewer department, including entering sewer mains through manholes when there was a sewer line problem.
In October 1988, as instructed, he entered a manhole to clear a line and died of asphyxia before he could be removed.
Collins alleged that: her husband's death was caused by the City's policy of not providing safety training to its employees; there was a custom for safety equipment to either not be taken to, or used at, the job site; no warnings or instructions were given on the hazards in entering sewer lines or how to protect against them; several months before her husband's death, his supervisor entered a manhole and was rendered unconscious, placing the City on notice of the risks in sending its employees into the lines; the City systematically and intentionally failed to provide the equipment, training or instruction required by the Texas Hazard Communication Act; and, inter alia , this pattern of behavior by the City was a custom and policy of deliberate indifference to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of its employees.
1 The district court granted a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, expressly taking into consideration the applicable causation standard ("deliberate indifference to constitutional rights") set by City of Canton v. Harris , 489 U.S. 378 , 109 S.Ct. 1197 , 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989), but noting that an "abuse of governmental power" was lacking, stating first: (Citations omitted.)
It next ruled that a municipality's improper action against its employee does not constitute ipso facto deprivation of a constitutional right; and held that because a constitutional right had not been violated, an action under 1983 could not lie.
II.
The question presented in this case is whether a plaintiff seeking recovery under 1983 for injury to a governmental employee must demonstrate, inter alia , that the conduct in issue was an abuse of governmental power.
More particularly, does alleged wrongful conduct by government--in its capacity as employer rather than as a governing authority--that deprives its employee of an alleged constitutional right give rise to a 1983 action?
We base our holding on the abuse of government power standard, separate from the constitutional deprivation element or standard.
The district court appears to have merged those two standards, which are among those necessary for bringing 1983 into play here.
In reviewing this Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, we will keep them separate.
2 Section 1983 42 U.S.C. 1983 .
In Monell v. Dep't of Social Servs.
, 436 U.S. 658 , 98 S.Ct. 2018 , 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), the Supreme Court held that a 1983 action could lie against a municipality only where it "implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body's officers," or where "constitutional deprivations [occurred] pursuant to governmental 'custom' even though such a custom has not received formal approval through the body's official decision making channels."
Id. at 690-91 , 98 S.Ct. at 2035-36 .
Earlier, in Paul v. Davis , 424 U.S. 693 , 96 S.Ct. 1155 , 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976), the Court rejected the idea that "the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and 1983 make actionable many wrongs inflicted by government employees which had heretofore been thought to give rise only to state-law tort claims."
Id. at 699 , 96 S.Ct. at 1159 .
Furthermore, mere negligence is insufficient to establish municipal liability under 1983 .
Daniels v. Williams , 474 U.S. 327, 330-31 , 106 S.Ct. 662, 664-65 , 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986).
As stated fairly recently by the Supreme Court in the above-cited City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris , the "first inquiry in any case alleging municipal liability under 1983 is whether there is a direct causal link between a municipal policy or custom, and the alleged constitutional deprivation."
109 S.Ct. at 1203 .
City of Canton concerned a 1983 action for violation of an alleged Fourteenth Amendment right to receive proper medical attention while in post-arrest police custody, arising in part out of inadequate training of the custodial police officers concerning when to summon medical care for a detainee.
For such failure to train cases, the Supreme Court noted there was "substantial division among the lower courts as to what degree of fault must be evidenced by the municipality's inaction before liability will be permitted" and held that "inadequacy of police training may serve as the basis for 1983 liability only where the failure to train amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into contact."
Id. at 1204 (emphasis by Court).
City of Canton does not permit all municipal failure to train actions to lie under 1983 , as is reflected by the Court's restatement of its holding: 1983 Id. at 1206 .
City of Canton arises out of the use, or abuse, of government power; the holding springs from a citizen being held in custody after arrest, without the ability to control or choose a necessary course of action and being dependent upon the government to do so. The holding establishes only the degree of fault that must be alleged and proved in 1983 actions against a municipality in certain failure to train cases; it does not hold that all such cases alleging the requisite causation lie under 1983 .
In this Circuit, there is a separate standard that must also be satisfied--an abuse of government power.
While this element is in many ways similar to, and often blends with, other necessary elements for a 1983 action, such as deprivation of a constitutional right, and springs from the same sources as the deprivation element, it is separate nonetheless.
Keeping these standards in mind, we turn to Collins' complaint, in which she makes the requisite Monell and City of Canton allegations, charging that the City's "custom and policy of deliberate indifference towards the safety of its employees" violated the constitutional rights of her deceased husband.
This notwithstanding, our holding is grounded in the abuse of power standard, which pertains to the decedent's relationship with the City--one of employer and employee, rather than one in which the City, as government, acted against the decedent, as governed.
Therefore, it is not necessary to reach another of the standards, or elements, necessary for a 1983 action--whether there was a deprivation of a constitutional right.
3 Collins contends that pursuant to City of Canton , her claim is sufficient to withstand Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal.
But, as discussed above, Collins reads too much into City of Canton .
It pertained to cases concerning use of governmental power on the governed, to government qua government, consistent with the reminder in Daniels that Paul v. Davis 424 U.S. 693 701 [96 S.Ct. 1155, 1160 47 L.Ed.2d 405 Parratt v. Taylor 451 U.S. 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1917 68 L.Ed.2d 420 474 U.S. at 332 , 106 S.Ct. at 665 .
Collins has received payments pursuant to the worker's compensation law of Texas; 4 and we express no opinion whether she might have a cause of action under state law. 5 In any event, and as held repeatedly in controlling precedent in this Circuit, she does not have a 1983 claim against the City.
Such precedent is found, for example, in Rankin v. City of Wichita Falls , 762 F.2d 444 (5th Cir.1985); Hogan v. City of Houston , 819 F.2d 604 (5th Cir.1987); and de Jesus Benavides v. Santos , 883 F.2d 385 (5th Cir.1989) (rendered after City of Canton and DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept.
of Social Services , 489 U.S. 189 , 109 S.Ct. 998 , 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989)).
In Rankin , a situation tragically similar to the case at hand, a municipal water treatment plant employee drowned while attempting to save another who had fallen into one of the tanks.
The action against the city charged that work site safety defects constituted a municipal custom and practice which caused a deprivation of a constitutional right.
This court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint for failing to state a claim under 1983 .
Because the case predated City of Canton's fixing the causation standard, the court assumed that the complaint sufficiently alleged conduct to meet "whatever standard is necessary to state a constitutional claim under section 1983 ."
762 F.2d at 447 .
However, the court explained that simply alleging, or meeting, a causation standard for cases such as this is not enough to permit an action under 1983 .
section 1983 section 1983 Id. at 447-448 .
Accordingly, the court found possible 1983 liability wanting, "because the existence of the alleged work place defects did not amount to a misuse of government power " Id. at 449 .
The court further explained this controlling distinction: Id. at 449 .
The court held that "the plaintiffs have made out at most the abuse of power which any private employer might be guilty, not the abuse of any particular authority or obligation held by the government "; that the injury must be attributed to a misuse of power made possible only because the City is clothed with authority of state law."
Id. at 447, 449 (emphasis added).
6 In Hogan v. City of Houston , 819 F.2d 604 (5th Cir.1987), also rendered before City of Canton, a police officer alleged that city policies allowed a prisoner to seize another officer's gun and shoot the plaintiff officer; that these policies "manifest[ed] deliberate indifference to or conscious disregard" for his safety.
This court affirmed the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal by applying the Rankin holding that the complaint failed to allege the requisite abuse of government power.
And, in de Jesus Benavides v. Santos , 883 F.2d 385 (5th Cir.1989), decided after City of Canton , this court applied the Rankin analysis to a 1983 claim by jail detention officers, injured by inmates during an attempted escape.
In doing so, it also applied similar decisions from other Circuits and the then recent decision by the Supreme Court in DeShaney , handed down only six days before City of Canton .
DeShaney involved a 1983 action against a governmental entity and its employees (the government) for child abuse injuries; it was alleged that the government's failure to protect the child from his custodial father constituted a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process violation.
Although, obviously, DeShaney did not involve the employment relationship in issue here, it is applicable because it holds that not all injuries arising out of an association or relationship with the government give rise to a 1983 claim, even if all other elements for that claim are present.
One contention in DeShaney was that because the government was aware of the danger to the child and took some action to protect him, it acquired a duty to do so in a proper manner, and the failure to do so was an abuse of governmental power that constituted a substantive due process violation.
In rejecting the contention, the Court noted it was "true that in certain limited circumstances the Constitution imposed upon the [government] affirmative duties of care and protection with respect to particular individuals," but this arose only e.g. 109 S.Ct. at 1004-1006 (citations omitted).
Accordingly, this court stated in Benavides that DeShaney "confirm[ed] the rationale of several of our similar recent cases," including Rankin and Hogan .
883 F.2d at 387 .
Based upon the facts in Benavides , this court noted that Washington [v. District of Columbia 802 F.2d [1478, 1482 Walker [v. Rowe 791 F.2d [507, 511 cert. denied 479 U.S. 994 107 S.Ct. 597 93 L.Ed.2d 597 883 F.2d at 388 .
Collins contends that the determinative factor making this a proper post City of Canton 1983 action is simply that the defendant is " a governmental body " (emphasis by Collins); that we should "not focus on the relationship between the public entity and the injured or deceased person"; that the alleged deliberate indifference, without more, constitutes the necessary "abuse of governmental authority"; and that the strict, or high, causation standard fixed by City of Canton removes the concerns that lead to establishing the abuse of government power standard.
As part of, or alternative to, her contention that the abuse of government power standard employed by Rankin and other cases was replaced, or subsumed, by the City of Canton causation standard, Collins asserts that even if an abuse of government power must be alleged, she has done so sufficiently for Rule 12(b)(6) purposes, relying, in part, on the recent Eighth Circuit holding in Ruge v. City of Bellevue , 892 F.2d 738 (8th Cir.1989).
7 In Ruge , the 1983 action alleged that the City had a deliberate policy of not shoring ditches and required employees to work in them without warning of such danger.
For Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, the city urged the court to apply the reasoning from Rankin and McClary v. O'Hare , 786 F.2d 83 (2nd Cir.1986), "that in an employer-employee relationship where the plaintiff fails to show the state conduct complained of was of a 'uniquely governmental character' there is no abuse of government authority and thus no improper state action."
892 F.2d at 741 .
The Ruge court, however, distinguished McClary , ruling that McClary held instead that the death "was not caused by any established state procedure and therefore did not constitute a constitutional deprivation."
8 Id. The Ruge court discussed, but did not attempt to distinguish, Rankin .
Ruge reversed the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, holding that "an abuse of government authority arises sufficient to state a cause of action under section 1983 ," when a death, including of a municipal employee, "is caused by an inadequate municipal policy, adopted with the requisite culpability."
Id. at 741 n. 6.
In so holding, the court stated: McClary 786 F.2d at 87 actively pursued See City of Canton 109 S.Ct. at 1204 Id. at 742 (emphasis added).
We are unable to find sufficient shades of difference with the Ruge holding to allow us to not find it in conflict with our controlling precedent.
9 Ruge might compel finding here that the alleged municipal policy is an abuse of government authority or, stated differently, conduct that was of a "uniquely government character," sufficient to preclude Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal.
We respectfully disagree.
Furthermore, we are bound by our controlling Fifth Circuit precedent.
As demonstrated, it has not been changed by a Supreme Court decision; in fact, it is solidified by that Court's decisions.
10 There was no abuse of government power.
This is not an instance "when the state by the affirmative exercise of its powers so restrains an individual's liberty that it renders him unable to care for himself."
DeShaney , 109 S.Ct. at 1005 .
It is "not a case in which a government official, because of his unique position as such, was able to impose a loss on an individual."
McClary , 786 F.2d at 89 .
Nor was there "a misuse of power made possible only because the City [was] clothed with authority of state law."
762 F.2d at 449 .
Accordingly, this action cannot lie under 1983 .
III.
The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
