 HARRY T. EDWARDS , Circuit Judge: In this case, appellants challenge the constitutionality of 40 U.S.C. 13k , which declares: 40 U.S.C. 13k (1976).
1 As interpreted and applied by the Marshal of the Supreme Court, the individual responsible for the enforcement of the statute, section 13k prohibits all expressive conduct, including all picketing and leafletting, on the Supreme Court grounds.
2 For the reasons set forth below, we find that this statute is repugnant to the First Amendment of the Constitution.
While public expression that has an intent to influence the administration of justice may be restricted, Cox v. Louisiana , 379 U.S. 559 , 85 S.Ct. 476 , 13 L.Ed.2d 487 (1965), Congress has accomplished that result with a more narrowly drawn statute, 18 U.S.C. 1507 , that is fully applicable to the Supreme Court grounds.
Since we are unable to find any other significant governmental interest to justify the absolute prohibition of all expressive conduct contained in section 13k , we hold that the statute is unconstitutional and void.
As a result, appellants are entitled to the declaratory and injunctive relief that they seek.
I. BACKGROUND The facts of this case are not in dispute.
3 In May 1978, appellant Thaddeus Zywicki, an elderly Catholic missionary, went by himself to the sidewalk in front of the Supreme Court to distribute a leaflet to passersby.
Standing near a coin-operated vending machine selling the Washington Star , appellant attempted to distribute a reprint of a "letter to the editor" published [**377] in the Washington Post concerning the removal of unfit judges from the federal bench.
After distributing a few leaflets, appellant was approached by a member of the Supreme Court police, who advised appellant that Title 40 of the United States Code prohibited leafletting anywhere on the Supreme Court grounds.
Fearing arrest, appellant departed.
On January 8, 1980, appellant Zywicki returned to the Supreme Court sidewalk to distribute pamphlets that contained an invitation to, and information about, several religious meetings concerning oppressed peoples of Central America.
As before, appellant was told that he would be arrested if he continued to distribute the leaflets.
On February 4, 1980, appellant again returned to leaflet.
On this occasion, however, Zywicki informed the police officer that a decision of the District of Columbia Superior Court had narrowed the application of 40 U.S.C. 13k to prohibit only conduct engaged in "with the intent to disrupt or interfere with or impede the administration of justice or with the intent of influencing the administration of justice."
4 The officer radioed a person inside the Supreme Court building for clarification, and a Mr. White emerged and stated that the statute had not been changed and that appellant was subject to arrest for leafletting on the sidewalk.
Appellant protested that newspapers were permitted to be sold while he was denied the right to distribute printed matter of his choosing, but peacefully left the grounds.
Upon learning of these events, appellant Mary Grace appeared on the sidewalk in front of the Supreme Court on March 17, 1980, and stood there alone with a sign that recited verbatim the words of the First Amendment.
Shortly after her arrival, a Supreme Court police officer approached appellant and told her that her conduct violated Title 40 of the United States Code.
The officer advised appellant that, unless she left the grounds, she would have to accompany the officer into the building.
Fearing arrest, appellant Grace left.
On May 13, 1980, appellants Zywicki and Grace filed a complaint in the District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that 40 U.S.C. 13k is unconstitutional on its face, and a permanent injunction prohibiting the Supreme Court police from enforcing the statute.
Both parties filed motions for summary judgment on the merits of this controversy.
On August 7, 1980, however, the District Court dismissed appellants' complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
R. 8 (Memorandum Opinion).
This ground for dismissal had not been briefed or argued by either party in the District Court.
In this appeal, appellants contend that the dismissal of the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies was improper.
Appellants also seek a judgment from this court declaring 40 U.S.C. 13k void on its face, and an injunction prohibiting further enforcement of section 13k .
5 In response, although seeking an affirmance, the Government does not advance the exhaustion of administrative remedies reasoning relied upon by the District Court.
Rather, the Government contends that the complaint was properly dismissed because section 13k is a proper limitation of expressive conduct on the grounds of the Supreme Court.
II.
EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES The District Court dismissed this action on the ground that appellants failed to apply to the Supreme Court Marshal for a permit to engage in the conduct for which [**378] they now seek judicial protection.
Given the circumstances of this case, the judgment of the District Court was plainly erroneous.
We hold that appellants' complaint should not have been dismissed for failure to secure a permit or for failure to otherwise pursue some ill-defined administrative remedy.
The statutory scheme at issue here makes no provision for obtaining a permit to leaflet or picket on the Supreme Court grounds.
Section 13k flatly prohibits all expressive conduct on the Court grounds, not merely expressive conduct engaged in without a permit or license.
Compare, e.g. , Cox v. New Hampshire , 312 U.S. 569 , 61 S.Ct. 762 , 85 L.Ed. 1049 (1941); Poulos v. New Hampshire , 345 U.S. 395 , 73 S.Ct. 760 , 97 L.Ed. 1105 (1953).
Furthermore, no administrative procedures have been established by which persons may obtain permission to leaflet or picket on Supreme Court grounds.
6 Most importantly, the Government has conceded in this case that all expressive conduct--without exception--is forbidden on Court grounds.
The Supreme Court police officers who approached appellants did not indicate that appellants' conduct might be permitted if prior approval from the Marshal were obtained.
In addition, the Marshal's affidavit to the District Court makes it absolutely plain that no expressive conduct will be permitted on the grounds of the Supreme Court.
7 Thus, so far as the Government is concerned, section 13k does not contemplate or require any permit or licensing procedure for expressive conduct on Court grounds.
In these circumstances, dismissal of the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies was without justification.
No administrative remedies existed for appellants to exhaust.
While appellants conceivably could have sought formal permission from the Supreme Court Marshal, such action would have been an empty--and thus unnecessary--ritual.
As stated by Chief Judge Robinson in Lodge 1858, American Federation of Government Employees v. Paine , 436 F.2d 882 (D.C.Cir.1970), "the exhaustion requirement contemplates an efficacious administrative remedy, and does not obtain when it is plain that any effort to meet it would come to no more than an exercise in futility."
436 F.2d at 896 (separate opinion).
The mere fact that the position of Marshal exists, and that the person in that position may possess the power to withhold enforcement of section 13k , does not mean that an "efficacious administrative remedy" was available to appellants.
The statute sets forth no criteria under which the Marshal could determine whether to grant or deny an application for permission to leaflet or picket.
This alone would call into question the judgment of the District Court.
As the Supreme Court has held, "a law subjecting the exercise of First Amendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license, without narrow, objective, and definitive [**379] standards to guide the licensing authority, is unconstitutional," Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham , 394 U.S. 147, 150-51 , 89 S.Ct. 935, 938-39 , 22 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969); moreover, the Court also noted that "a person faced with such an unconstitutional licensing law may ignore it and engage with impunity in the exercise of the right of free expression for which the law purports to require a license."
Id. at 151 , 89 S.Ct. at 939 .
See also Lovell v. City of Griffin , 303 U.S. 444 , 58 S.Ct. 666 , 82 L.Ed. 949 (1938).
8 For all of the foregoing reasons, we reject the decision of the District Court dismissing appellants' complaint for failure to secure a permit or otherwise to exhaust an administrative remedy.
III.
THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF 40 U.S.C. 13k The Government contends that the District Court was correct in dismissing appellants' complaint, since the prohibition of expressive conduct contained in section 13k does not unduly interfere with First Amendment rights of free speech.
Appellants strongly dispute this contention, and assert that section 13k is unconstitutional on its face.
We turn to consider this significant question of constitutional law. 9 A. Freedom of Expression in Public Places Cases concerning the rights of individuals to express opinions or air grievances on public property are among the most important in our jurisprudence.
In countless cases heard over the years, the Supreme Court has strived to reconcile the clear directive of the First Amendment that "Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech" 10 with legitimate needs of the Government to limit expression on certain public property so that governmental functions may be conducted safely and properly.
In certain of these cases the Court has recognized a broad right of access to public property for purposes of free expression, while in others the Court has been more restrictive of First Amendment freedoms.
We first address these divergent groups of cases and set forth an overall method of analysis that may be gleaned from the decisions of the Court.
1.
Cases Establishing Broad Rights of Access The Supreme Court has long recognized the importance of access to public places for [**380] purposes of free speech.
In Hague v. CIO , 307 U.S. 496 , 59 S.Ct. 954 , 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939), the Court declared unconstitutional a local ordinance that prohibited "public parades or public assembly in or upon the public streets, highways, public parks or public buildings" without a permit from a local official, which permit could be refused "for the purpose of preventing riots, disturbances or disorderly assemblage."
307 U.S. at 502 n.1, 59 S.Ct. at 958 n.1.
In words at times considered the cornerstone for determining the rights of individuals to use public streets and parks for the expression of political or religious views, 11 Justice Roberts stated: Id. at 515 , 59 S.Ct. at 963 (plurality opinion).
Since the ordinance could be used as "the instrument of arbitrary suppression of free expression of views on national affairs," id. at 516 , 59 S.Ct. at 964 , the Court declared the law "void upon its face."
Id. The right to use public property for free expression has been expanded beyond public sidewalks and parks.
In Edwards v. South Carolina , 372 U.S. 229 , 83 S.Ct. 680 , 9 L.Ed.2d 697 (1963), the Supreme Court reversed breach of peace convictions of 187 Black high school and college students who had conducted an orderly demonstration on the South Carolina State House grounds.
During their demonstration, the students had walked--single file or two abreast--carrying placards with messages such as "I am proud to be a Negro" and "Down with segregation."
372 U.S. at 231 , 83 S.Ct. at 681 .
The students had assembled on the State House grounds, which housed the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches of the South Carolina Government, to express their grievances "to the citizens of South Carolina, along with the Legislative Bodies of South Carolina."
Id. at 235 , 83 S.Ct. at 683 .
The Supreme Court held that, in arresting, convicting, and sentencing the students, the State had infringed constitutionally protected rights of free speech, free assembly, and freedom to petition the Government for the redress of grievances.
The Court stated that "[t]he circumstances in this case reflect an exercise of these basic constitutional rights in their most pristine and classic form."
Id. Following Edwards v. South Carolina , other cases of the Court have reenforced and further established rights of expression on public property.
In Brown v. Louisiana , 383 U.S. 131 , 86 S.Ct. 719 , 15 L.Ed.2d 637 (1966), the Supreme Court vacated the convictions of five individuals found to have violated a breach of peace statute by conducting a peaceful and silent "sit-in" in the reading room of a public library.
12 Although the Court held that the evidence did not support a violation of the breach of peace statute, four Justices of the majority also stated that the protestors' actions were protected by the First Amendment.
13 Similarly, in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District , 393 U.S. 503 , 89 S.Ct. 733 , 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969), the Supreme Court declared that the First Amendment protected the right of school children to wear black armbands in school in protest against the Vietnam War.
Subsequently, in Jeannette Rankin Brigade v. Chief of Capitol Police , 342 F.Supp.
575 (D.D.C.
), aff'd mem. , 409 U.S. 972 , 93 S.Ct. 311 , 34 L.Ed.2d 236 (1972), the Court affirmed, without opinion, a decision of a three-judge District Court declaring unconstitutional [**381] an Act of Congress that prohibited processions or assemblages on the United States Capitol grounds.
14 Thus, First Amendment rights of expression have been found to exist in public streets and parks, on State House and the United States Capitol grounds, on the sidewalk in front of the White House, in public schools, and, by four Justices of the majority in Brown v. Louisiana , in the reading room of a public library.
In these diverse situations, it has been held that the State may not impose a complete prohibition on the use of public property as a forum in which individuals may share ideas or express grievances against the Government.
2.
Cases Restricting First Amendment Activity The Supreme Court also has held that rights of expression on public property are not absolute.
In the landmark decision of Cox v. New Hampshire , 312 U.S. 569 , 61 S.Ct. 762 , 85 L.Ed. 1049 (1941), the Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of a statute that prohibited a parade or procession on public streets without a license, since the statute, as construed, conveyed authority only to take into account "considerations of time, place and manner so as to conserve the public convenience."
312 U.S. at 575-76 , 61 S.Ct. at 765-66 .
The Court noted that this limited control over the time and place of expression served to afford the opportunity for proper policing, and to prevent the confusion that could result from overlapping parades or processions.
Id. at 576 , 61 S.Ct. at 765 .
15 The legacy of Cox v. New Hampshire has remained.
Indeed, the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed that activities protected by the First Amendment "are subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions."
Heffron v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. , 452 U.S. 640, 647 , 101 S.Ct. 2559, 2563 , 69 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981).
In certain situations, the Supreme Court has upheld relatively substantial restrictions on the right to use public property for expressive activity.
In Cox v. Louisiana , 379 U.S. 559 , 85 S.Ct. 476 , 13 L.Ed.2d 487 (1965), the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a state statute that provided: 379 U.S. at 560 , 85 S.Ct. at 478 .
Although the Supreme Court ruled that the State was "estopped" from invoking the statute, id. at 571 , 85 S.Ct. at 484 , the Court also held "that this statute on its face is a valid law dealing with conduct subject to regulation so as to vindicate important interests of society and that the fact that free speech is intermingled with such conduct does not bring with it constitutional protection."
Id. at 564 , 85 S.Ct. at 480 .
At issue in Cox v. Louisiana was a demonstration of 2,000 persons, gathered across the street from the courthouse, 101 feet from its steps.
A major purpose of the demonstration was to protest what was considered to be an illegal arrest of 23 students who were detained in the courthouse building.
[**382] Id. at 566 , 85 S.Ct. at 481 .
The Supreme Court noted that "[t]here can be no question that a State has a legitimate interest in protecting its judicial system from the pressures which picketing near a courthouse might create," id. at 562 , 85 S.Ct. at 479 ; and concluded: Id. The Court made clear, however, that critical to its decision was the fact that the statute was drawn narrowly to apply only to picketing with an intent to interfere with the administration of justice.
As stated by the Court: Id. at 567 , 85 S.Ct. at 482 .
Soon after the decision in Cox v. Louisiana , the Court handed down Adderley v. Florida , 385 U.S. 39 , 87 S.Ct. 242 , 17 L.Ed.2d 149 (1966), affirming the convictions of 32 persons found to have violated a state trespass statute by conducting a demonstration on jailhouse grounds.
The demonstrators in Adderley had entered the jail grounds through a driveway used only for purposes related to jailhouse business, without warning to, or permission from, the sheriff.
In reviewing the case, the Court noted that jails, built for security purposes, are not traditionally open to the public, and emphasized that: Id. at 45 , 87 S.Ct. at 246 .
Noting that the sheriff objected only to the presence of the demonstrators "on that part of the jail grounds reserved for jail uses," id. at 47 , 87 S.Ct. at 247 , the Court affirmed the convictions.
In these circumstances, the Court held that the State "has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated."
Id.
Relying in part on Adderley , a recent line of cases have held that, on public property not properly designated as a "public forum," the State may significantly restrict free expression.
In Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights , 418 U.S. 298 , 94 S.Ct. 2714 , 41 L.Ed.2d 770 (1974), the Court upheld a municipal decision not to accept paid political advertising for its mass transit system advertising space, noting that the decision was made "in order to minimize chances of abuse, the appearance of favoritism, and the risk of imposing upon a captive audience."
418 U.S. at 304 , 94 S.Ct. at 2717 .
Similarly, in Greer v. Spock , 424 U.S. 828 , 96 S.Ct. 1211 , 47 L.Ed.2d 505 (1976), relying on both "the historically unquestioned power of [a military] commanding officer summarily to exclude civilians from the area of his command," id. at 838 , 96 S.Ct. at 1217 ( quoting Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy , 367 U.S. 886, 893 , 81 S.Ct. 1743, 1747 , 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961)), and "the American constitutional tradition of a politically neutral military establishment under civilian control," id. at 839 , 96 S.Ct. at 1218 , the Supreme Court held that a regulation prohibiting all political speeches on a federal military base did not violate the First Amendment.
Most recently, relying on "[t]he interest in preserving order and authority in the prisons," the Court, in Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc. , 433 U.S. 119, 132 , 97 S.Ct. 2532, 2541 , 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977), upheld regulations promulgated by the North Carolina Department of Correction [**383] that prohibited inmates from soliciting other inmates to join a prisoners' union, barred all meetings of the union, and denied bulk mailing privileges to union publications.
3.
Analyzing Cases Concerning Freedom Of Expression On Public Property Unfortunately, even upon careful and extended review, it is difficult to discern a unifying thread of analysis that binds the Supreme Court decisions concerning freedom of expression on public property.
In at least a handful of cases, the Court has determined that certain public facilities were not "public forums;" in these cases, it appears that the challenged restrictions on freedom of expression have been subjected to a low level of scrutiny by the Court.
For example, in Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc. , 433 U.S. 119 , 97 S.Ct. 2532 , 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977), the Court stated that, since a prison is not a public forum, prison authorities "need only demonstrate a rational basis for their distinctions between organizational groups."
433 U.S. at 134 , 97 S.Ct. at 2542 .
Similarly, in Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights , 418 U.S. 298 , 94 S.Ct. 2714 , 41 L.Ed.2d 770 (1974), a plurality of the Court stated that "the policies and practices governing access to the transit system's advertising space must not be arbitrary, capricious, or invidious."
418 U.S. at 303 , 94 S.Ct. at 2717 .
These judicial statements seem at odds with the general principle that governmental restrictions of free speech will be upheld only upon a showing that the restriction is essential to the furtherance of a substantial governmental interest.
As stated in United States v. O'Brien , 391 U.S. 367 , 88 S.Ct. 1673 , 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968), a governmental restriction of free speech 391 U.S. at 377 , 88 S.Ct. at 1679 .
Very recently, in Heffron v. International Society of Krishna Consciousness, Inc. , 452 U.S. 640 , 101 S.Ct. 2559 , 69 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981), the Supreme Court reaffirmed, without qualification, that "[a] valid time, place, and manner regulation [of First Amendment activities] must also 'serve a significant governmental interest.'"
101 S.Ct. at 2563 ( quoting Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc. , 425 U.S. 748, 771 , 96 S.Ct. 1817, 1830 , 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976)).
Although some aberrations seemingly do appear, upon close examination we do not find these various opinions of the Supreme Court to be essentially inconsistent.
It is true that the Supreme Court has suggested in the so-called "non-public forum" cases that a lesser degree of scrutiny may be applicable; however, the determination that a public facility is not a "public forum" has been accompanied in each of these cases by an expression of important governmental interests justifying the State to preserve the property for the use to which it was lawfully dedicated.
Military bases, for instance, are established solely to train soldiers and defend the nation, and require, for the successful accomplishment of those objectives, a large degree of discipline, order and restrictions on civilian access.
Prisons are established solely to house and rehabilitate those convicted of crime, and require, in order to maintain security and order, extensive restrictions on individual freedom and autonomy.
These facilities possess, by their very nature, peculiar characteristics that entitle the State to impose greater restrictions on expression than would be allowed for public sidewalks or parks.
Even in cases involving these facilities, however, the Supreme Court has noted that First Amendment privileges remain that are not inconsistent with the State's legitimate use of the property.
As recognized in Jones , "a prison inmate retains those First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives [**384] of the corrections system."
433 U.S. at 125 , 97 S.Ct. at 2537 ( quoting Pell v. Procunier , 417 U.S. 817, 822 , 94 S.Ct. 2800, 2804 , 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974)).
Thus, we believe that the decisions of the Supreme Court dictate that whenever the Government denies freedom of expression on property generally open to the public, the restriction must be justified by a significant governmental interest--whether that interest derives from the very nature of the property itself, or from some other source.
Moreover, the restriction on freedom of expression can be no greater "than is essential to the furtherance of that interest."
United States v. O'Brien , 391 U.S. 367, 377 , 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1679 , 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
Certainly, even peaceful expression may be prohibited "when it interferes with the operation of vital governmental facilities," Carey v. Brown , 447 U.S. 455, 470 , 100 S.Ct. 2286, 2295 , 65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980); the State retains the power "to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated."
Adderley v. Florida , 385 U.S. 39, 47 , 87 S.Ct. 242, 247 , 17 L.Ed.2d 149 (1966).
As perhaps best stated in Grayned v. City of Rockford , 408 U.S. 104, 116 , 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2303 , 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972), "[t]he crucial question is whether the manner of expression is basically incompatible with the normal activity of a particular place at a particular time."
With these principles in mind, we turn to consider the present case. B. Freedom of Expression and the Supreme Court Grounds In this case, we are concerned with a statute that, as construed, prohibits all expressive conduct in the Supreme Court building and on the Supreme Court grounds.
The statutory prohibition applies whether or not the message conveyed concerns any matter pending before the Court; public expression is also banned no matter what effect is intended or produced by the message.
The statute applies whether or not the Court is in session, and extends to the broad sidewalks that surround the Supreme Court building, which are at all times of the day and night open to the public.
Indeed, the statute, on its face, conceivably prohibits the wearing of an expressive T-shirt or button declaring "I love America" on the sidewalk in front of the Supreme Court building at 10 o'clock at night.
Thus, we are not concerned with a narrow regulation that governs the time, place and manner of expression, or solely protects the efficient functioning of the physical structure.
The statute, as construed, flatly prohibits all expressive conduct.
Substantial governmental interests certainly exist to justify restrictions on picketing and other forms of expression in and near courthouses.
The constitutional safeguards of due process that attend judicial proceedings in this country leave no room for influence or domination of the judiciary by public pressure; arguments to courts properly are presented in official pleadings, briefs and memoranda, not on placards.
Although "[j]udges are supposed to be men [and women] of fortitude, able to thrive in a hardy climate," Craig v. Harney , 331 U.S. 367, 376 , 67 S.Ct. 1249, 1255 , 91 L.Ed. 1546 (1947), the Supreme Court has recognized that "judges are human; and the legislature has the right to recognize the danger that some judges will be consciously or unconsciously influenced by demonstrations in or near their courtrooms."
Cox v. Louisiana , 379 U.S. 559, 565 , 85 S.Ct. 476, 481 , 13 L.Ed.2d 487 (1965).
Along with these considerations, "[a] State may also properly protect the judicial process from being misjudged in the minds of the public."
Id.
Due to the possibility that a court may adopt, coincidentally, a position forcefully urged by courthouse demonstrators, "[a] State may protect against the possibility of a conclusion by the public that the judge's action was in part a product of intimidation and did not flow only from the fair and orderly working of the judicial process."
Id.
We need not determine the extent to which these concerns are applicable to proceedings before the United States Supreme Court.
As described above, the statute at issue is in no way limited to expression that [**385] may risk influencing a Supreme Court Justice, or, probably more realistically, that may distort public perceptions of Supreme Court decisionmaking.
16 Indeed, the legislative history of section 13k demonstrates no particularized congressional concerns with either the fair administration of justice or public confidence in the judicial process.
17 More importantly, however, these legitimate concerns are fully addressed by 18 U.S.C. 1507 , which provides: 18 U.S.C. 1507 (1976).
The constitutionality of a state statute modeled on section 1507 was upheld by the Supreme Court in Cox v. Louisiana , supra .
Section 1507 prohibits expressive conduct on the Supreme Court grounds designed to influence Supreme Court Justices or to interfere with the administration of justice; therefore, we can find no justification for the absolute prohibition of all expressive conduct contained in 40 U.S.C. 13k .
The Government argues, however, that the absolute ban on expressive conduct contained in section 13k is necessary and appropriate to maintain the dignity and decorum of the Supreme Court.
Indeed, it would appear that this is the sole justification of the statute advanced in the legislative history.
18 Although this interest admittedly is not protected in explicit terms by 18 U.S.C. 1507 , 19 we do not believe that this concern alone is sufficient to justify the absolute prohibition of free expression contained in this statute.
In Jeannette Rankin Brigade v. Chief of Capitol Police , 342 F.Supp.
575 (D.D.C.
), aff'd mem. , 409 U.S. 972 , 93 S.Ct. 311 , 34 L.Ed.2d 236 (1972), a three-judge District Court considered a similarly worded statute prohibiting all parading or picketing on the United States Capitol grounds.
In declaring the law unconstitutional on its face, the court explicitly rejected an argument that "the 'peace,' 'serenity,' 'majesty,' maintenance of a 'park-like setting,' and the 'glorification of a form of government through visual enhancement of its public buildings,'" justified an exclusion of all public [**386] expression on the Capitol grounds.
342 F.Supp.
at 585 .
The court unequivocally stated, "[t]he desire of Congress, if such there be, to function in the 'serenity' of a 'park-like setting' is fundamentally at odds with the principles of the First Amendment."
Id.
Unquestionably, the majesty of the Supreme Court building can and does instill public confidence in the important governmental functions conducted inside.
However, while the Capitol and Supreme Court buildings house different governmental entities, justifying different restrictions on free expression, we believe that an interest in "the glorification of a form of government through visual enhancement of its public buildings" can no more justify an absolute prohibition of free expression on the Supreme Court grounds than on the grounds of the United States Capitol.
The sight of a sole picketer may indeed mar an otherwise pristine morning or perfectly centered snapshot.
However, it is just that annoyance--if such be the case--that may cause bystanders or passersby to stop and take notice, to become aware of an issue, to formulate a response to a companion.
This awareness and interchange is, in part, precisely what the First Amendment is designed to protect.
An interest in the "peace" and "decorum" of the Supreme Court cannot alone justify the absolute abridgement of expressive conduct of section 13k .
Indeed, the Government cannot fairly assert that all expressive conduct outside the Supreme Court will adversely affect the peace and decorum of the Court.
Thus, even if the asserted interest is legitimate by itself, it cannot justify the total ban at issue here.
We simply do not believe that all expressive conduct "interferes with the operation of [this] vital governmental facilit[y]."
Carey v. Brown , 447 U.S. 455, 470 , 100 S.Ct. 2286, 2295 , 65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980).
Unlike the situation presented in Adderley v. Florida , 385 U.S. 39 , 87 S.Ct. 242 , 17 L.Ed.2d 149 (1966), where over 100 demonstrators blocked vehicular passage over a jail driveway "not normally used by the public, but by the sheriff's department for transporting prisoners to and from the courts several blocks away and by commercial concerns for servicing the jail," id. at 45 , 87 S.Ct. at 246 , the prohibition at issue here is not necessary for the Government "to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated."
Id. at 47 , 87 S.Ct. at 247 .
The Government has offered nothing to suggest that all expressive conduct on the sidewalk of the Supreme Court "is basically incompatible with the normal activity of [that] particular place at [that] particular time."
Grayned v. City of Rockford , 408 U.S. 104, 116 , 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2303 , 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972).
Nor is it sufficient, as the Government suggests, that other nearby locations exist where freedom of expression is not abridged.
As the Supreme Court flatly declared in Schneider v. State , 308 U.S. 147 , 60 S.Ct. 146 , 84 L.Ed. 155 (1939): 308 U.S. at 163 , 60 S.Ct. at 151 .
Indeed, "[f]reedom of expression would not truly exist if the right could be exercised only in an area that a benevolent government has provided as a safe haven for crackpots."
Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District , 393 U.S. 503, 513 , 89 S.Ct. 733, 740 , 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969).
20 [**387] In short, we find no interest to justify the absolute prohibition of expression contained in section 13k .
Indeed, we believe that it would be tragic if the grounds of the Supreme Court, unquestionably the greatest protector of First Amendment rights, stood as an island of silence in which those rights could never be exercised in any form.
We emphasize that expressive conduct designed to disrupt the Supreme Court or to in any way influence the administration of justice is not protected by our opinion today.
Such conduct is properly prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 1507 .
Nor do we suggest that any individual may picket or leaflet in the Supreme Court building itself.
The statute at issue, however, prohibits expressive conduct unrelated to any business of the Supreme Court, throughout the Supreme Court grounds.
Since such a blanket prohibition is inconsistent with the principles of the First Amendment, the statute is void on its face.
In so holding, we need not examine the facts of the present case to determine whether the particular conduct engaged in by appellants is protected by the First Amendment.
As the Supreme Court recently stated in Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment , 444 U.S. 620 , 100 S.Ct. 826 , 63 L.Ed.2d 73 (1980): 444 U.S. at 634 , 100 S.Ct. at 834 .
21 We have held that the absolute prohibition of section 13k , which prohibits expressive conduct unrelated to any business of the Supreme Court throughout the Supreme Court grounds, unduly abridges First Amendment rights.
Thus, while on the record before us appellants' conduct would appear to be unrelated to any business of the Court and protected by the First Amendment, we need not so determine.
Since the statute is not narrowly drawn to further a legitimate State interest, appellants are entitled to the relief that they seek.
In an effort to save section 13k with a narrowing construction, the dissenting opinion suggests that "the section should be limited to prevent expressive conduct aimed at promoting and propagandizing political parties and the various causes that are supported by the many movements extant in our pluralistic society."
Dissenting op. at 1209.
It is unclear, however, to what extent, if any, that construction would operate as less than an absolute prohibition.
The dissenting opinion ultimately construes "political parties," "organizations," "movements," and "causes" in such a way as to encompass virtually all expressive conduct.
Thus, we cannot discern in the dissent's view of section 13k any comprehensible departure from the Government's construction of the statute, i.e. , it would ban all expressive conduct at all times and on all of the public grounds surrounding the Supreme Court.
22 While we would prefer to adopt a narrowing construction of the statute in order [**388] to avoid a holding that section 13k is unconstitutional, Crowell v. Benson , 285 U.S. 22, 62 , 52 S.Ct. 285, 296 , 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932), a validating construction is simply impossible here.
Section 13k 's slim legislative history suggests only the desire on the part of Congress to surround the Court with the same cordon of silence that Congress attempted to place around the Capitol, see notes 17 and 18 supra , a measure struck down on First Amendment grounds in Jeannette Rankin Brigade v. Chief of Capitol Police , 342 F.Supp.
575 (D.D.C.)
(three-judge court), aff'd mem. , 409 U.S. 972 , 93 S.Ct. 311 , 34 L.Ed.2d 236 (1972).
Combined with the statute's all-encompassing terms and with decades of consistently broad enforcement, this legislative history precludes a limiting interpretation.
G. Endlich, a Commentary on the Interpretation of Statutes 178-180 (1888).
Indeed, the Government concedes that section 13k is a total ban of all expressive conduct on the grounds surrounding the Supreme Court.
Congress, of course, may legislate to narrowly restrict expressive conduct on the Supreme Court grounds that threatens significant governmental interests, but the creation of new statutes must be left to that body.
Aptheker v. Secretary of State , 378 U.S. 500, 515-17 , 84 S.Ct. 1659, 1668-69 , 12 L.Ed.2d 992 (1964).
In the end analysis, we simply cannot agree with our dissenting colleague that the interests in order and decorum can, consistently with the First Amendment, justify a total prohibition of all expressive conduct at all times and on all of the Supreme Court grounds.
23 IV.
RELIEF As a result of our holding in this case, appellants are entitled to a declaratory judgment that 40 U.S.C. 13k is unconstitutional on its face, and to a permanent injunction prohibiting the Government from enforcing section 13k .
We remand this case to the District Court to enter the appropriate relief.
So ordered .
