 PER CURIAM.
Appellant was convicted, on each of 15 counts of an indictment, for violations of the narcotics laws.
He was sentenced, on each count, to imprisonment for 20 months to 5 years and a fine of $500.
Three of the sentences were to run consecutively and the other 12 "concurrently with" the consecutive sentences.
The court said: "In other words, the aggregate sentence is not less than five years and not more than 15 years, and a $1,500.00 fine."
The record supports at least 5 of the sentences that were to run "concurrently with" the 3 consecutive sentences.
It therefore supports the aggregate sentence.
We need not decide whether it supports the "consecutive" sentences themselves.
