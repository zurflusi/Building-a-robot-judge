 DUNIWAY , Circuit Judge.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue asks us to reverse decisions of the Tax Court.
We are of the opinion that the decisions must be affirmed.
Involved is a transaction of the type described by Moore and Dohan in an article entitled: "Sales, Churches and Monkeyshines," 11 Tax.L.Rev.
87 (1956), and by Lanning in an article entitled: "Tax Erosion and the 'Bootstrap sale' of a Business," 108 U. of Pa.L.Rev.
623 (1960).
The transaction is described in great detail in the findings of the Tax Court, which are reported at 37 T.C. 461 .
In his opening brief the Commissioner states: "No exception is taken to the detailed basic findings of the Tax Court."
In the same brief the Commissioner summarizes what he contends are the essentials of the transaction.
We quote the summary, but with additions, in brackets, from the record: We think we should add to this summary certain additional findings and conclusions of the Tax Court which are: 1.
That there was a change of economic benefits in the transaction.
2.
That the primary motivation of the Institute was the prospect of ending up with the assets free and clear after the purchase price had been fully paid, which would then permit the Institute to convert the property into money for use in cancer research.
In the court below the Commissioner took two alternative positions: One was that the transaction was a sham.
This position is abandoned here.
The other, which the Commissioner also takes before us, was that the Tax Court erred in holding that there was a sale within the meaning of section 117(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and section 1222(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 because, so the Commissioner says, certain normal aspects of the sale of a business were missing.
These are (1) shift of business risk; (2) shift of benefit of income; (3) shift of operational control; (4) permanent shift of ownership of assets and (5) release of sellers from business indebtedness.
The Commissioner relies upon Burnet v. Harmel , 1932, 287 U.S. 103 , 53 S.Ct. 74 , 77 L.Ed. 199 as to shift of business risk, upon Helvering v. Clifford , 1940, 309 U.S. 331 , 60 S.Ct. 554 , 84 L.Ed. 788 as to shift of benefit of income, and on Commissioner v. Sunnen , 1948, 333 U.S. 591 , 68 S.Ct. 715 , 92 L.Ed. 898 as to shift of operational control.
We think that the Commissioner's contentions are well answered in the opinion of the Tax Court, and also in the following cases: Commissioner v. Johnson , 1 Cir., 1959, 267 F.2d 382 ; Union Bank v. United States , Ct.Cl., 1961, 285 F.2d 126 .
Here, as in those cases, there was a transfer of title; there was a shift of business risk in the sense that the operation of the business was in the hands of a new company owned by third persons, albeit managed under a contract by one of the taxpayers; there was a shift of benefit of income in the sense that Fortuna retained 20% of it and the Institute retained 10% of 80%; there was no understanding that the assets were to come back to the taxpayers under any circumstances other than a default in the payment of the purchase price; there was a permanent shift of ownership of assets.
The management contract and the guarantee of certain of Fortuna's borrowings by one of the taxpayers (Clay Brown), were designed to secure the payment of the price.
There was no understanding that, if the business should be unsuccessful, Brown would take action to "trigger" a default, thus causing a reversion of the mortgaged assets to the taxpayers.
As was said by the court in Commissioner v. Johnson , supra , "The mere fact that the security holders may in the future have to resume proprietorship of the enterprise does not nullify the fact that they had sold those proprietary interests."
( 267 F.2d at 385 ) The Commissioner relies also on Kolkey v. Commissioner , 7 Cir., 1958, 254 F.2d 51 .
This case was distinguished in Commissioner v. Johnson , supra , on the ground that in Kolkey the facts were different and the Tax Court had found, in substance in that case, that there was no sale.
The Tax Court made the same distinction here, and we think it was correct.
We think that the real holding in Kolkey, was that the transaction was a sham.
Here, the finding is the other way and the evidence sustains it.
There is no question that this transaction took the form that it did because the Institute is a tax-exempt corporation and that the price to be paid was probably greater for that reason.
These facts may have some relevance in connection with possible tax liabilities of the Institute, but they do not, as a matter of law, establish that, so far as the taxpayers were concerned, the sale of their stock was not a genuine sale, which is the only issue involved in this case.
We think that it is of some significance that the problem of misuse by tax-exempt organizations of their tax exemption in transactions similar to this was considered by the Congress, which adopted certain remedial legislation in the Revenue Act of 1950.
The history of this legislation appears in H.R.Rep.
No. 2319, 81st Cong. 2d Sess., 1950-2, Cum.Bull.
330, 408-11, and in S.Rep.
No. 2375, 81st Cong. 2d Sess., 1950-2, Cum.Bull.
483, 502 ff.
Certain aspects of the transaction now before us were undoubtedly "tailored" to fit the law as amended by Congress in 1950, particularly section 101 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 as amended, and sections 421 , 422, and 423.
These sections all relate to the income and tax exempt status of the purchasing Institute; none of them purports to deny to the sellers the right to treat the sale, for tax purposes, as a sale, and therefore to treat moneys received as capital gains.
Congress could have dealt with that aspect of such transactions but did not do so.
If, as is indicated by the writers of the articles cited at the beginning of this opinion, the present situation, insofar as the tax position of the sellers is concerned, is undesirable from a tax standpoint, it is still possible for Congress to provide a remedy.
Affirmed.
