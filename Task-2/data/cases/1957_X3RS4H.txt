 PER CURIAM.
Here twice before under a Section 2255 ( 28 U.S.C.A. 2255 ) proceeding, Smith v United States , 5 Cir., 223 F.2d 750 ; Smith v. United States , 5 Cir., 238 F.2d 925 , rehearing 240 F.2d 347 , Smith, by this third appeal, presents for the first time an appeal 1 from the criminal conviction and sentence entered after our last remand.
On the hearing, the District Court set aside the sentence of conviction adjudging a thirty-year prison term and then imposed a sentence of ten years.
But the Court denied the successive motions made by Smith to withdraw his (a) plea of guilty, (b) waiver of venue, (c) waiver of counsel and (d) waiver of indictment.
2 By suitable language in the opinion itself and by similar precise terms in the mandate, we sought on rehearing, 3 240 F.2d 347 , to make plain that the sentence of conviction of thirty-years imprisonment was alone mandatorily to be set aside, and that as to the plea of guilty and waivers, the District Court was free to allow such of these as the interests of justice might require.
The District Court, finding expressly that the interests of justice did not so require, paid scrupulous heed to, and carried out, the precise terms of our mandate.
Whether the interests of justice required further action was of the very nature calling for the exercise of the highest order of reasoned judicial discretion.
Nowhere does Smith succeed in demonstrating that this conclusion lacks substantial basis.
All relief sought must therefore be denied; the judgment appealed from is affirmed, the denial of application for habeas corpus is affirmed and the alternative writ of mandamus is denied.
Affirmed and denied.
