 FLETCHER , Circuit Judge: Woodward appeals from a conviction on two counts for failing to report approximately $22,000 in United States currency he was carrying as he entered the country.
We affirm his conviction under 31 U.S.C. 1058 (1976), the second count, but reverse his conviction under 18 U.S.C. 1001 (1976), the first count, because we conclude that the section 1001 offense merges into the section 1058 conviction pursuant to the statutory interpretation rule of Blockburger v. United States , 284 U.S. 299 , 52 S.Ct. 180 , 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).
FACTS On March 1, 1980, Charles Noel Woodward, the defendant and appellant, arrived with his wife Diane at Los Angeles International Airport on an incoming flight from Brazil.
Woodward filed a U.S. Customs declaration form on which he stated that neither he nor any member of his family was carrying monetary instruments in excess of $5,000 into the United States.
Under 31 U.S.C. 1101 (1976), Woodward was required to report any such currency in excess of $5,000.
While the Woodwards were being processed through customs, Customs inspectors determined that Woodward was a fugitive from prosecution in Greece.
The inspectors also noticed an unnatural-looking bulge under Diane Woodward's clothing.
When they told Woodward that his wife would be taken to a private room for a secondary search, Woodward admitted that he and his wife were carrying about $22,000 in unreported United States currency.
A subsequent search of Diane Woodward revealed $10,000 in $100 denomination bills concealed in a money belt secured about her waist.
Charles Woodward produced approximately $12,000, which he had hidden in his boot.
Following the discovery of the money, Woodward was interviewed by Customs Agents Donald Shruhan and Robert Olson in a small search room at the airport.
The agents asked Woodward to explain the circumstances surrounding his transportation of the unreported currency.
Woodward told him that the money came from an insurance settlement relating to a burglary he had suffered while in Belgium.
During this interview, Woodward also said that while he was in Belgium, an unidentified person at the U.S.
Embassy had informed him that he was required to declare the currency to customs officials.
But Woodward added that he did not report the currency because he thought that the requirement applied only to "personal money," and that "insurance money" was separate.
Following the interview, which according to Agent Olson lasted between fifteen and twenty minutes, Woodward was permitted to leave the airport.
Customs officials retained all but $1,560 of the unreported funds, however, pending forfeiture proceedings pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1102(a) (1976).
Later, Woodward undertook a series of efforts to obtain remission of the seized funds, pursuant to the authority of 31 U.S.C. 1104 (1976).
He wrote to the Director of Customs, and on March 27, 1980, he met with two customs agents in his apartment.
In November, 1980, Woodward visited the office of Ronald Edelstein, Chief of Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures for the Customs Service, in San Pedro, California.
Edelstein advised Woodward to contact Assistant United States Attorney Steven Petersen in Los Angeles to obtain information about the status of his case. On December 11, Woodward met with Petersen in Petersen's office.
Woodward volunteered the entire story of the unreported currency.
In contrast to the story Woodward told the customs investigators at the airport, however, Woodward told Petersen that he did not declare the currency on the form because a vice-consul in South Africa had told him that insurance proceeds could be declared orally.
At no time during his airport detention and interrogation or subsequent conversations with Government officials was Woodward informed that he could be subject to criminal prosecution and that any statement he made could be used against him in such a proceeding.
Yet the Justice Department on December 16, 1980 filed a two-count indictment charging Woodward with violating 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 31 U.S.C. 1101 by failing to declare the currency in excess of $5,000 that he was carrying.
At trial, the Government relied upon the inconsistencies among Woodward's statements to help establish that he had known of the reporting requirement.
Woodward was convicted on both counts.
On the 18 U.S.C. 1001 count, he was sentenced to six months in prison; on the 31 U.S.C. 1058 count (which punishes violations of 31 U.S.C. 1101 (1976)), he received a consecutive sentence of three years of probation.
Also, Woodward was ordered to inform any future employer of this criminal record.
From these convictions, Woodward now appeals.
I Merger of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 31 U.S.C. 1058 .
The two counts of Woodward's indictment charged him with two separate offenses based on the exact same conduct: His false declaration that he was not carrying over $5,000 in United States currency.
1 The first count charged that Woodward had willfully made a false statement to the Government when he submitted the false Customs declaration, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 , the statute that punishes fraud against the United States Government.
The second in effect alleged that the submission of the false declaration violated the currency reporting statute, 31 U.S.C. 1101 , and was therefore punishable under 31 U.S.C. 1058 , which provides criminal sanctions for such violations.
Due to the unusual combination of criminal charges pressed against Woodward stemming from the same overt act, we withdrew the case from submission and requested additional briefs in order to consider two questions: (1) whether 18 U.S.C. 1001 can properly be applied to convict a traveler who violates the currency reporting statute, and (2) if so, whether a defendant can be separately and cumulatively punished for section 1001 and section 1101 violations arising from the same occurrence.
The first question has since been answered in the affirmative.
In United States v. Duncan , 693 F.2d 971, 975 (9th Cir.1982), this circuit ruled that a defendant may be charged and convicted under 18 U.S.C. 1001 even though 31 U.S.C. 1058 expressly prohibits the same conduct.
But Duncan did not involve, and thus did not decide, the question whether multiple punishments under both section 1001 and section 1058 may be aggregated consistently with the rule of Blockburger v. United States , 284 U.S. 299 , 52 S.Ct. 180 , 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).
2 We now answer that question in the negative.
In Blockburger v. United States , 284 U.S. at 304 , 52 S.Ct. at 182 , the Supreme Court laid down the basic rule that still governs the question whether a defendant can be punished cumulatively for one instance of conduct that violates two statutory provisions.
"[T]he test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact that the other does not."
Accord , Dixon v. Dupnik , 688 F.2d 682, 684 (9th Cir.1982); United States v. Goodheim , 686 F.2d 776, 780 (9th Cir.1982); United States v. Sanford , 673 F.2d 1070, 1073 (9th Cir.1982).
3 Where analysis under the Blockburger rule reveals that two statutory provisions describe the same offense, the Supreme Court has consistently held that the two provisions will not be construed to authorize cumulative punishments in the absence of a clear indication of contrary legislative intent.
See Missouri v. Hunter , U.S. , 103 S.Ct. 673, 678 , 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983); Whalen v. United States , 445 U.S. 684, 691-92 , 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1437-38 , 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980).
We must therefore examine the elements of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 31 U.S.C. 1058 to determine whether each requires proof of a fact that the other does not.
4 18 U.S.C. 1001 , 5 as applied to a person who fails to properly declare currency in excess of $5,000, requires proof of elements strikingly similar to those necessary to procure a criminal conviction under the currency reporting statutes, 31 U.S.C. 1101 6 and 1058.
7 A section 1001 conviction requires proof that the defendant (1) willfully falsified (2) a material fact (3) in a statement made with regard to any matter within the jurisdiction of a United States agency.
See United States v. Rose , 570 F.2d 1358, 1363 (9th Cir.1978).
A conviction under 31 U.S.C. 1058 necessarily entails proof of all of these elements.
31 U.S.C. 1052(k) (1976) expressly states that "[f]or the purposes of section 1001 of Title 18 the contents of reports required under any provision of this chapter are statements and representations in matters within the jurisdiction of an agency of the United States."
And in United States v. Masters , 612 F.2d 1117, 1122 (9th Cir.1979), cert. denied , 449 U.S. 847 , 101 S.Ct. 134 , 66 L.Ed.2d 57 (1980), we held that the concealed fact that a defendant was carrying over $5,000 in unreported currency was "material" for purposes of section 1001 .
Finally, section 1058 provides only for punishment of "willful" violations of the section 1101 reporting requirement.
In our view, the only "fact" that an 18 U.S.C. 1001 conviction might possibly require, but that a 31 U.S.C. 1101 conviction does not, is some affirmative misrepresentation on the part of the defendant.
Section 1058 would plainly provide a basis for prosecuting a traveler who said nothing at all or who submitted a blank form when carrying monetary instruments in excess of $5,000, so long as the traveler knew both that he was carrying the instruments and that he was required by law to report them.
See United States v. Carrier , 654 F.2d 559, 561 (9th Cir.1981) (requirement that act be "willful" means that it must be done "deliberately and with knowledge," citing Hirsch v. INS , 308 F.2d 562, 567 (9th Cir.1962)).
8 18 U.S.C. 1001 by its express terms reaches any defendant who willfully "conceals or covers up" a material fact.
A willful failure to file a customs report on currency in excess of $5,000 (as opposed to an innocent failure, which could not be prosecuted under 31 U.S.C. 1058 ) is a form of "concealment."
We have previously held that "concealment" may be punished under 18 U.S.C. 1001 .
United States v. Masters , 612 F.2d 1117, 1122 (9th Cir.1979), cert. denied , 449 U.S. 847 , 101 S.Ct. 134 , 66 L.Ed.2d 57 (1980) (gems concealed on person of Master's companion).
We conclude that 18 U.S.C. 1001 could be applied to punish a traveler who willfully fails to file a report listing currency in excess of $5,000.
It follows that a conviction under 31 U.S.C. 1058 necessarily includes all elements of an 18 U.S.C. 1001 violation.
The Blockburger test therefore yields a strong presumption that Congress intended a willful failure to report currency to constitute a single offense.
The Blockburger test is a rule of statutory construction giving rise to a presumption against multiple punishment where its application as here results in a determination that the conduct is "one offense."
See Missouri v. Hunter , U.S. , 103 S.Ct. 673, 678-79 , 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983).
The presumption is overcome only by a clear indication of congressional intent to the contrary.
See Whalen v. United States , 445 U.S. 684, 692 , 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1438 , 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980).
We ask, therefore, whether we can find any "clear indication" of congressional intent to allow cumulative punishment under both statutory sections.
The history of 18 U.S.C. 1001 does not show such an intent, in the first instance because that history was already complete by 1971 when the currency reporting statute was passed.
Section 1001 was amended to its present form largely to provide a criminal sanction for reporting statute violators where other statutory sanctions are unavailable.
See United States v. Gilliland , 312 U.S. 86, 93-95 , 61 S.Ct. 518, 522-23 , 85 L.Ed. 598 (1941).
In considering a similar question, we have decided that section 1001 should be presumed not to apply in a manner that would duplicate the criminal sanctions imposed under other law.
In United States v. Rose , 570 F.2d 1358, 1363 (9th Cir.1978), Judge Wright stated for the court that section 1001 1001 Likewise, no clear indication of Congress's intent to impose double punishments under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 31 U.S.C. 1058 is found in the rather sparse legislative history of the latter statute.
The legislative statements generally suggest that Congress did not consider the possibility of double punishment when enacting the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act.
9 The most comprehensive and typical statement is contained in a Senate Report that accompanied the legislation: S.Rep.
No. 1139, 91st Cong., 2d Sess.
7 (1970).
From this discussion, we glean no evidence of any kind that Congress intended to impose section 1001 penalties upon currency reporting violators in addition to those provided by 31 U.S.C. 1058 .
Certainly, the "clear indication" that would be necessary to override the Blockburger test is not manifest.
10 We consequently must apply the Blockburger rule of statutory construction to hold that Congress intended the failure to report currency in excess of $5,000 upon entry into or departure from the United States to constitute only a single offense.
For the foregoing reasons, we hold that 18 U.S.C. 1001 is an included offense within a conviction under 31 U.S.C. 1058 stemming from a willful violation of 31 U.S.C. 1101 .
11 Where a defendant is improperly convicted of violating both section 1001 and another statute that includes all elements of section 1001 , our practice has been to vacate the section 1001 conviction.
E.g. , United States v. Rose , 570 F.2d 1358, 1363 (9th Cir.1978).
This practice flows from the general rule that a conviction for a lesser included offense merges into a conviction for the greater offense.
12 See United States v. Parson , 452 F.2d 1007, 1009 (9th Cir.1971); Whalen v. United States , 379 A.2d 1152, 1158 (D.C.1977), rev'd on other grounds , 445 U.S. 684 , 100 S.Ct. 1432 , 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980).
Accordingly, Woodward's conviction on Count One is reversed.
II Miranda Violation Woodward also contends that his conviction should be reversed because it was based upon statements obtained in violation of the rights protected by the rule of Miranda v. Arizona , 384 U.S. 436 , 86 S.Ct. 1602 , 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).
Woodward's Miranda claim focuses upon the fact that the various Customs and Justice Department officials with whom he spoke never advised him that his statements might be used as incriminating evidence in a later criminal prosecution.
He contends that had he been given such a warning, he would not have made assertions to Agents Shruhan and Olson and to Assistant U.S. Attorney Petersen that were inconsistent with the statements he made to Customs inspectors at the airport.
We need not decide whether Woodward's Miranda rights were violated because we conclude that even if statements were obtained in violation of Miranda , their admission into evidence was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt and the conviction must be sustained.
To establish a violation of 31 U.S.C. 1058 , Government prosecutors were required to prove only two things: (1) that Woodward attempted to carry unreported currency in excess of $5,000 into the United States, and (2) that he did so deliberately, knowing that he was required to submit a currency report to U.S. Customs officials.
Even excluding all statements obtained from the defendant after he claims he should have been given Miranda warnings, the evidence against Woodward on both points was overwhelming.
Woodward signed and submitted a customs declaration form that stated that neither he nor any family member was carrying over $5,000.
Evidence at trial indicated that Woodward was familiar with the form.
The money was found secreted in Woodward's boot and in a money belt concealed under his wife's clothing.
Woodward's admission to the customs agents that he had been told of his legal obligation to declare the currency, and the "inconsistency" between this statement and later statements made by Woodward, were immaterial.
Woodward's trial defense that his failure to declare the currency was the product of misunderstanding or mistake was without support in the record and was therefore totally implausible.
For these reasons, we conclude that any error in the admission of statements made by Woodward to government officials after Woodward claims he should have received Miranda warnings was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
13 The conviction under 31 U.S.C. 1058 is affirmed.
See United States v. Duncan , 693 F.2d 971, 979 (9th Cir.1982); United States v. Lemon , 550 F.2d 467, 471 (9th Cir.1977); United States v. Casimiro-Benitez , 533 F.2d 1121, 1124-26 (9th Cir.), cert. denied , 429 U.S. 926 , 97 S.Ct. 329 , 50 L.Ed.2d 295 (1976).
CONCLUSION The conviction under 31 U.S.C. 1058 is affirmed; the conviction under 18 U.S.C. 1001 is reversed.
When one of several convictions is reversed because of merger, the general rule in this circuit is that the entire sentence must be vacated and the case remanded for reconsideration of the proper sentence to be imposed.
See United States v. Diogenes , 638 F.2d 125, 128 (9th Cir.1981); United States v. Oropeza , 564 F.2d 316, 324 (9th Cir.1977), cert. denied , 434 U.S. 1080 , 98 S.Ct. 1276 , 55 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976); United States v. Parson , 452 F.2d 1007, 1009 (9th Cir.1971).
From the record in the present case, however, it appears that Woodward has fully served his sentence on Count One (the invalid section 1001 conviction), a six month prison term that began in March, 1981.
All that remains is the three year probation period imposed under Count Two.
14 Under these circumstances, the district court upon remand may reduce or vacate this probation period, but cannot increase it or order the defendant to serve an additional prison term.
Otherwise, an illegal cumulation of punishment would result.
United States v. Edick , 603 F.2d 772, 778 (9th Cir.1979).
Subject to this consideration, the case is remanded for resentencing.
AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.
