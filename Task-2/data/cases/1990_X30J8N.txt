 TUTTLE , Senior Circuit Judge: This appeal arises from a declaratory judgment action brought by St. Vincent's Hospital (St. Vincent's) to determine its obligations under the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, 38 U.S.C. 2021 et seq.
, commonly known as the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act.
St. Vincent's had denied a three year leave of absence requested by its employee King, a sergeant major in the Alabama National Guard, because King contended that he was entitled to reemployment rights following the termination of a three year tour of duty with the Alabama National Guard.
St. Vincent's filed this declaratory judgment action seeking to have the court declare it not to be liable for King's reemployment under the Act.
The trial court found that King's request for a three year leave of absence was "unreasonable" and entered judgment in favor of St. Vincent's.
I. STATEMENT OF FACTS The parties stipulated to the facts which were then considered by the trial court, together with depositions on file.
We find that the trial court properly summarized the agreed upon facts as follows: The provision of the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act governing King's right to request and receive a leave of absence from his employer is codified at 38 U.S.C. 2024(d) which states in pertinent part as follows: 38 U.S.C. 2024(d) .
II.
ISSUES 1.
Is Section 2024(d) subject to a "reasonableness" test in its application?
2.
Did the trial court err in finding that King's application for leave was per se "unreasonable" or, if not, should the judgment be affirmed because it was "unreasonable" under the circumstances of this case?
III.
DISCUSSION This Court and its predecessor, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, have played a prominent part in the construction of Section 2024(d) , Gulf States Paper Corp. v. Ingram , 811 F.2d 1464 (11th Cir.1987); Lee v. City of Pensacola , 634 F.2d 886 (5th Cir.1981).
1 Although the Lee decision is binding precedent for this Court, in Gulf States , we stated: "[W]e are further articulating the legal reasonableness standard."
811 F.2d at 1468 (1987).
Thus, we look to Gulf States for our guidance.
A. " Per Se Unreasonable " As authorized under the Act, King was represented by the United States Department of Justice.
Unlike the unsuccessful employee in Lee and the successful employee in Gulf States , the United States takes the position in this case, that "the plain language of 38 U.S.C. 2024(d) does not place any limitations on the duration of a leave of absence protected by the Act."
App.Br.
p. 17.
This Court in Gulf States rejected this argument if it was made.
2 This Court stated: Section 2024(d) Lee 634 F.2d at 889 Lee Gulf States , 811 F.2d at 1468 .
We thereafter stated: the length of the leave, Ingram's actions, and burden upon Gulf States Monroe v. Standard Oil Co. 452 U.S. 549 101 S.Ct. 2510 69 L.Ed.2d 226 Lee Gulf States , 811 F.2d at 1469 (emphasis added).
That factor, of course, requires us to consider the good faith of the employee.
In Gulf States , we stated: "Bad faith conduct might also be shown through requests for leaves of exceptional duration."
811 F.2d at 1470 n. 4.
In considering the issue involved in the length of the leave, we stated: "We agree that although one year is not per se unreasonable, a greater length of time might reach that level."
Id. at 1469 .
The government contends that these statements by us in Gulf States are dicta .
Nevertheless, we consider them as providing guidance in deciding the present case. The statements were used in our attempt carefully to describe the elements that a court must consider in determining whether a request for leave is reasonable.
Significantly, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in its decision in Eidukonis v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority , 873 F.2d 688 (3rd Cir.1989), adopted as the law of the Third Circuit our decisions in Gulf States and Lee .
Although there was a dissenting opinion in Eidukonis , the dissenting judge agreed that the statute should be construed under a standard of reasonableness.
The dissent pointed out that: Government of Virgin Islands v. Berry 604 F.2d 221, 225 United States v. Kirby 74 U.S. (7 Wall.)
482, 486-87 19 L.Ed. 278 Section 2024(d) Eidukonis , 873 F.2d at 699 .
The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has articulated this standard of construing a federal statute most aptly in United States v. Mendoza , 565 F.2d 1285 (5th Cir.1978).
In that case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated: Holy Trinity Church Rector of Holy Trinity Church v. United States 143 U.S. 457 12 S.Ct. 511 36 L.Ed. 226 565 F.2d at 1288 .
We are, of course, bound by the previous decisions of this Court applying the "reasonableness" test.
However, we note that even were we not so bound, we would independently arrive at the same result.
Moreover, as the Court in Eidukonis said: 38 U.S.C. 2024(d) Monroe 452 U.S. at 555 101 S.Ct. at 2514 Eidukonis , 873 F.2d at 693 .
As noted above, the trial court found that the three year leave of absence in this case would be per se unreasonable.
It, therefore, becomes incumbent on us to determine whether such an interpretation of the statute is necessary to prevent an absurd, unjust, or unintended result.
We conclude that it is.
The trial court, after carefully considering the three factors which we stated in Gulf States were applicable to a reasonableness determination, stated: Gulf States Gulf States 811 F.2d at 1470 It is thus clear that the court construed the length of the requested leave of absence in the context of the conduct prong which we articulated in Gulf States .
We also think that the determination whether a three year leave was unreasonable was partially dependent upon the harm to the employer.
Although the burden on the employer was partially weighted by the adoption of the statute by Congress, no one could doubt that a longer leave would inevitably be more burdensome on an employer than a short leave.
This Court in Gulf States stated that "bad faith conduct might also be shown through requests for leave of exceptional duration."
We hold, especially in light of the Supreme Court's statement in Monroe that this section of the statute was passed "to deal with problems faced by employees who had military training obligations lasting less than three months," Monroe , 452 U.S. at 555 , 101 S.Ct. at 2514 , and, in view of the self-contradictory legislative history of the section, that it is appropriate for this Court to determine a definite limit beyond which any leave would be unreasonable.
No case has been called to our attention in which a leave of absence of as long as three years has been held protected under Section 2024(d) .
We, therefore, agree with the trial court that a three year leave of absence is per se unreasonable.
B. Unreasonableness on Factors Present in this Case Moreover, even if we should find that the trial court erred in finding a three year leave per se unreasonable, we would nevertheless hold that on the facts of this case, considering the factors outlined in Gulf States , the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed.
IV.
CONCLUSION The judgment is AFFIRMED.
