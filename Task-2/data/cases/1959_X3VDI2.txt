 CHAMBERS , Circuit Judge.
The judgment of conviction is affirmed.
We hold that the second judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California was legally justified sua sponte under the circumstances of this case in ordering the plea of guilty on the first and second counts withdrawn (which plea had been entered before another judge of the same court) and directing the entry of a plea of not guilty.
1 Further, we are convinced that the trial, after this change of plea, did not constitute double jeopardy 2 for the defendant.
3 The fifth count, the subject of a ten year sentence for Saldana, only charged "sale and facilitation of sale."
Obviously, under the testimony, Saldana was guilty of the crimes of possession of and transportation of unstamped narcotics, 4 but he was not charged with those crimes.
We are of the opinion that under the evidence (upon which defendant could have had upon request proper instructions as to the elements of sale) it was a question of fact for the jury whether there was a sale as charged in the fifth count.
5 We have examined all specifications of error and find those not mentioned hereinabove to be without substance.
Counsel's excellent presentation just overlooks the fact that there was never any plea of guilty or motion to dismiss on counts three, four and five.
So the court was justified in going ahead on those counts.
Had the court been less abrupt in proceeding, but firm nonetheless, defendant surely would have wanted to withdraw the guilty pleas on the first two counts.
The court not being willing to dismiss the last three counts, it would appear that what the court did was eminently fair.
Judgment affirmed.
