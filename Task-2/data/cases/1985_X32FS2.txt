 PREGERSON , Circuit Judge: In this case of first impression for an appellate court, we hold that the primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board preempts a trust fund's suit in district court under sections 502 and 515 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") to recover delinquent contributions accrued after a collective bargaining agreement has expired.
FACTS As a member of the Associated General Contractors of California ("AGC"), Advanced Lightweight Concrete Co. ("Advanced") was a signatory both to the 1980-83 Laborers Master Labor Agreement and to the 1980-83 Cement Masons Master Labor Agreement ("master agreements").
These multi-employer collective bargaining agreements included a requirement that Advanced contribute on behalf of its employees to: the Laborers Health and Welfare Trust Fund for Northern California; the Laborers Pension Trust Fund for Northern California; the Laborers Vacations-Holiday-Dues Trust Fund for Northern California; and the Laborers Training and Retraining Trust Funds for Northern California; and to the Cement Masons' Health and Welfare Trust Fund for Northern California; the Cement Masons Pension Trust Fund for Northern California; the Cement Masons Vacation-Holiday-Supplemental Dues Trust Fund for Northern California; and the Cement Masons Apprenticeship and Training Trust Fund for Northern California Fund ("trust funds").
The master agreements both incorporated the terms of the trusts by reference and specified the contributions due per employee hour worked from a signatory employer to the funds during the term of the agreement.
Before the expiration of the master agreements, Advanced withdrew AGC's authority to bargain on its behalf, and notified the Northern California District Council of Laborers of the Laborers International Union of North America AFL-CIO, the District Council of Plasterers and Cement Masons of Northern California, and the relevant local unions ("the unions") that it would not be bound by either the master agreements or any successor agreements beyond their June 15, 1983 expiration date.
Advanced also declared to the unions its readiness to negotiate independently.
While the parties disagree as to the nature of further contacts between Advanced and the unions, 1 it is not disputed that Advanced has not signed any collective agreement with either the Laborers' or Cement Masons' unions.
There is also no dispute that Advanced has paid no contributions to either trust fund since June 15, 1983.
In December 1983, the trust funds filed separate suits against Advanced seeking unpaid contributions from June 15, 1983.
In March and April 1984, the trust funds filed two further complaints demanding an audit of Advanced's books in accordance with the terms of the master agreements.
2 The former cases alleged jurisdiction based on ERISA 502 , 29 U.S.C. 1132 , and 515 , 29 U.S.C. 1145 , and Labor Management Relations Act ("LMRA") 301 , 29 U.S.C. 185 .
In May 1984, the four cases were consolidated as related cases under local rules.
Relying entirely on Cement Masons Health and Welfare Trust Fund for Northern California v. Kirkwood-Bly, Inc. , 520 F.Supp.
942 (N.D.Cal.1981), aff'd for the reasons stated in the district court's opinion , 692 F.2d 641 (9th Cir.1982), the district court held that it had no jurisdiction over the four related suits and granted summary judgment to Advanced.
Trust funds timely appealed.
STANDARD OF REVIEW A district court's determination that it is without subject matter jurisdiction is reviewed de novo .
Fort Vancouver Plywood Co. v. United States , 747 F.2d 547, 549 (9th Cir.1984).
In reviewing a district court's grant of summary judgment, all inferences from the evidence are viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment was granted.
Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. MCA, Inc. , 715 F.2d 1327, 1328-29 (9th Cir.1983).
DISCUSSION A. Freezing the status quo ante after a collective agreement has expired promotes industrial peace by fostering a non-coercive atmosphere that is conducive to serious negotiations on a new contract.
Thus, an employer's failure to honor the terms and conditions of an expired collective bargaining agreement pending negotiations on a new agreement constitutes bad faith bargaining in breach of sections 8(a)(1) , 8(a)(5) and 8(d) of the National Labor Relations Act ("NLRA"), 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(1) , 158(a)(5) and 158(d) .
NLRB v. Katz , 369 U.S. 736, 743 , 82 S.Ct. 1107, 1111 , 8 L.Ed.2d 230 (1962).
Consequently, any unilateral change by the employer in the pension fund arrangements provided by an expired agreement is an unfair labor practice.
Peerless Roofing Co. v. NLRB , 641 F.2d 734, 736 (9th Cir.1981); Producer's Dairy Delivery Co. v. Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust Fund , 654 F.2d 625, 627 (9th Cir.1981).
However, after bargaining to impasse, 3 the employer may unilaterally implement the best offer made in negotiations.
Katz , 369 U.S. at 745 , 82 S.Ct. at 1112 .
B. In granting summary judgment, the district court relied on Cement Masons Health and Welfare Trust Fund for Northern California v. Kirkwood-Bly, Inc. , 520 F.Supp.
942 (N.D.Cal.1981), aff'd for the reasons stated in the district court's opinion , 692 F.2d 641 (9th Cir.1982).
In Kirkwood-Bly , a trust fund sued under section 301 of the LMRA to recover contributions due after a collective agreement had expired but before impasse.
520 F.Supp.
at 943 .
The district court reasoned that a collective bargaining agreement does not "survive" in the sense that it continues as a legally operative document; rather, the agreement's terms "survive" in order to define the parameters of the employer's obligation under section 8(a)(5) to maintain the status quo during negotiations.
520 F.Supp.
at 943-945 .
Thus, the NLRB's primary jurisdiction preempts a suit to enforce the terms of an expired collective agreement.
4 The trust funds dispute the validity of Kirkwood-Bly to their suits.
Kirkwood-Bly expressly does not decide any similar trust fund suit brought under section 515 of ERISA.
520 F.Supp.
at 946 n. 2.
5 Moreover, in an opinion decided after the district court's grant of summary judgment to Advanced, Chief Judge Peckham, who wrote the district court opinion in Kirkwood-Bly , held that the NLRA does not preempt a section 515 suit to recover delinquent contributions due after the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement.
Laborers Health and Welfare Trust Fund v. Hess , 594 F.Supp.
273, 282 (N.D.Cal.1984).
6 Kirkwood-Bly thus is not necessarily determinative of the trust funds' suits insofar as they are based on section 515 of ERISA.
However, Kirkwood-Bly does, as both parties concede, mandate affirmance of summary judgment on the trust funds' section 301 -based causes of action.
C. Section 515 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. section 1145 , states: Section 515 was added to ERISA in 1980 by section 306(a) of the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendment Act ("MPPAA") 7 to allow trust funds to recover delinquent contributions from employers as expeditiously as possible.
8 In Hess , the court's conclusion that the NLRA does not preempt a section 515 suit after the collective agreement has expired relied heavily on statutory analysis.
Based on this analysis, the court characterized the purpose of section 515 as remedial.
Three other reported decisions have dealt explicitly with this issue subsequent to Hess , and all reach the opposite conclusion.
Mo-Kan Teamsters Pension Fund v. Botsford Ready Mix Co. , 605 F.Supp.
1441, 1444-48 (W.D.Mo.1985); U.A.
198 Health and Welfare Education and Pensions Funds v. Rester Refrigeration Service, Inc. , 612 F.Supp.
1033, 1036-38 (M.D.La.1985); Pattern Makers' Pension Trust Fund v. Badger Pattern Works, Inc. , 615 F.Supp.
792, 798-800 (N.D.Ill.1985).
9 Hess rests on three premises.
First, a phrase similar to "obligated to make contributions," which appears in section 515 , is defined elsewhere in ERISA as "an obligation to contribute arising (1) under one or more collective bargaining (or related) agreements, or (2) as a result of a duty under applicable labor-management relations law."
29 U.S.C. 1392(a) .
Subpart (2) of this definition would seem to include obligations created by section 8(a)(5) .
Since no other relevant definition appears in ERISA, Hess concludes that the phrase used in section 515 has a similarly broad scope.
594 F.Supp.
at 279 .
Yet, as Botsford points out, the section 1392(a) definition expressly refers only to withdrawal liability.
10 605 F.Supp.
at 1445 .
Hence, a more plausible conclusion is that Congress intended withdrawal liability to be more broadly based than employer's general liability for ERISA violations.
Second, Hess observes that section 515 applies to employers who are "obligated to make contributions under the terms of a collectively bargained agreement", 594 F.Supp.
at 279 (emphasis in original), and concludes that this specificity of phrase--and the absence of any other less precise phrase--suggests that section 8(a)(5) obligations were intended to fall within section 515 .
Id.
We believe this conclusion to be incorrect.
More persuasive is the similarity between the phraseology in section 515 and that in section 1392(a)(1) ("obligation to contribute arising under one or more collective bargaining agreements"), which would reinforce the conclusion that Congress intended section 515 liability to be less extensive than withdrawal liability.
As Botsford properly observes, there is no reason to believe that Congress would use "an ambiguous, metaphysical concept to define an obligation [in section 515 ] when it has used a crystal clear definition elsewhere [in section 1392 ] in the same act."
605 F.Supp.
at 1445 .
Third, Hess notes that the Congressional sponsors' statements indicate that the purpose of section 515 was to limit drastically the defenses available to employers in delinquent contributions suits.
594 F.Supp.
at 280-81 .
11 Since the disapproved defenses could be asserted equally after an agreement has expired as before, Hess concludes that "it would make little sense to limit section 515 to actions involving obligations based on extant collective bargaining agreements."
594 F.Supp.
at 281 .
Again the reasoning is unconvincing.
No indication exists that, during its deliberations on the MPPAA, Congress even considered the problem of continuing obligations from expired agreements much less that it had a view on resolving any conflict between section 515 and the primary jurisdiction of the NLRB.
12 D. Denying district court jurisdiction to the trust funds need not prejudice their claims against Advanced.
There is no bar to the trust funds' filing an unfair labor practice charge against Advanced.
29 U.S.C. 160(b) ; 29 C.F.R. 102.9 ("A charge that any person has engaged in or is engaging in any unfair labor practice affecting commerce may be made by any person.
"); see Local Union No. 25, International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. New York, New Haven and Hartford Co. , 350 U.S. 155, 160 , 76 S.Ct. 227, 230 , 100 L.Ed. 166 (1956) (railroad may file unfair labor practice charge); Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 298 v. County of Door , 359 U.S. 354, 357-58 , 79 S.Ct. 844, 846 , 3 L.Ed.2d 872 (1959) (county may file charge); Carpenters Local Union No. 1846 v. Pratt-Farnsworth, Inc. , 690 F.2d 489, 515-17 n. 11 (5th Cir.1982), cert. denied , 464 U.S. 932 , 104 S.Ct. 335 , 78 L.Ed.2d 305 (1983) ("[A]ny person, even a stranger to the collective bargaining agreement, can bring unfair labor practice charges.").
13 The dismissal of the unions' charge against Advanced, see note 1 supra , does not prevent the trust funds filing a separate charge: the unions' charge does not refer to a failure to pay trust fund contributions and in denying the complaint, the NLRB stated: "This office will fully investigate any future charge in this matter subject to the six month limitation period under Section 10(b) of the Act."
14 E. The lack of useful statutory or Congressional guidance on section 515 requires that the matter be decided by the application of accepted labor law principles.
When presented with a dispute that involves adjudicating conduct which "is arguably within the compass of 7 or 8 of the NLRA," a federal court must defer to the primary jurisdiction of the NLRB.
San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon , 359 U.S. 236, 245 , 79 S.Ct. 773, 779 , 3 L.Ed.2d 775 (1959).
"The desire to protect the primary jurisdiction of the NLRB flows from the need to maintain centralized administration of the NLRA by a specialized agency.
Labor law involves many difficult questions of policy best left to the agency that has the expertise needed to solve them.
Thus, the courts have traditionally shown great deference to the NLRB."
Burke v. French Equipment Rental, Inc. , 687 F.2d 307, 311 (9th Cir.1982).
See also Glaziers & Glassworkers Local Union No. 767 v. Custom Auto Glass Distributors , 689 F.2d 1339, 1342 (9th Cir.1982) (Congress intended matters of national labor policy to be decided first by NLRB).
In Kirkwood-Bly , the Ninth Circuit concluded that an employer's duty to pay trust fund contributions after a collective agreement has expired derives entirely from section 8(a)(5) and that a section 301 suit to recover unpaid contributions between expiration and impasse was preempted.
692 F.2d 641 (9th Cir.1982), affirming , 520 F.Supp.
at 944-45 .
The Kirkwood-Bly logic is equally persuasive in an ERISA-based suit.
As with the employer in Kirkwood-Bly , Advanced's failure to pay contributions after the master agreements' expiration is, at least, an arguable unfair labor practice.
While admittedly the failure to pay may also violate section 515 of ERISA, adjudication of the merits depends entirely on the section 8(a)(5) determination.
Without a section 8(a)(5) violation, there is no section 515 infraction.
Making this underlying labor law determination is exclusively an NLRB matter.
15 We find no persuasive evidence in either the plain words or legislative history of ERISA or the MPPAA that Congress intended section 515 to be an exception to the general rule of NLRB preemption for that narrow category of suits seeking recovery of unpaid contributions accrued during the period between contract expiration and impasse.
Therefore, the district court's grant of summary judgment to Advanced must be affirmed .
