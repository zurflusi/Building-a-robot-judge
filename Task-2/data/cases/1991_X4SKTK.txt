 WALD , Circuit Judge: Appellant Greater Washington Board of Trade ("Board") is a nonprofit corporation that provides health insurance to its employees.
The Board brought suit against appellees District of Columbia ("District") and Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon seeking an injunction against the enforcement of a provision of the District of Columbia Workers' Compensation Equity Amendment Act of 1990 (D.C. Act 8-261) ("Equity Amendment Act" or "Act"), 37 D.C.Reg.
6890 (1990) (codified in scattered sections of D.C.C ODE A NN.
36-301 to -342.1 (Supp. 1991)).
The Board claimed that section 2(c)(2) of the Equity Amendment Act was preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), 514(a) , 29 U.S.C. 1144(a) (1988).
1 Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the Act was not preempted by ERISA.
On March 27, 1991, the district court granted appellees' motion to dismiss and denied the Board's motion for a preliminary injunction.
See Greater Wash. Bd. of Trade v. District of Columbia , No. 91-00511 (D.D.C.
Mar. 27, 1991) ("Memorandum Opinion") at 2.
Because we find that the plain meaning of ERISA's preemption provision as well as the policies and purposes furthered by ERISA preemption compel the conclusion that section 2(c)(2) of the Equity Amendment Act is preempted, we reverse.
I. Background A. The Equity Amendment Act The Equity Amendment Act became effective on March 6, 1991.
2 The Act amended portions of the District's workers' compensation law, D.C.C ODE A NN.
36-301 to -345 (1981 & Supp.1991), "in order to promote a fairer system of compensation, facilitate a more expeditious processing of claims, and establish a Commission to study the procedure and method of rate-making for workers' compensation insurance," Equity Amendment Act preamble.
Although the Act amended several sections of the workers' compensation law, the only [**211] relevant provision on this appeal is the following: Equity Amendment Act 2(c)(2) (codified at D.C.C ODE A NN.
36-307 (a-1)(1), (3) (Supp.1991)).
By its terms, the Act requires employers to provide health benefits to employees eligible for workers' compensation benefits only if the employers already provide health benefits under a different plan.
The original version of the bill did not require employers to provide benefits to employees receiving workers' compensation; however, a substitute bill containing the provision for health benefits was passed by the Committee on Housing and Economic Development on July 6, 1990.
3 Section 2(c)(2) of the substitute bill read as follows: maintain the health insurance coverage of the employee D.C.Bill 8-74 (as amended), 2(c)(2) (1990) (emphasis added).
4 The Council amended the bill once again before it was passed.
The portion of the substitute bill italicized above was replaced by the language eventually included in the Act: provide health insurance coverage equivalent to the existing health insurance coverage of the employee Equity Amendment Act 2(c)(2) (codified at D.C.C ODE A NN.
36-307 (a-1)(1) (Supp. 1991)) (emphasis added).
B. ERISA ERISA was enacted in 1974 as a statutory scheme the primary purpose of which was to protect ERISA 2(b) (codified at 29 U.S.C. 1001(b) (1988)).
ERISA defines an "employee benefit plan" as either an employee welfare benefit plan--which generally provides for some combination of medical, health, sickness, accident, disability, death, or unemployment benefits--or an employee pension benefit plan--which generally provides for retirement income.

Discussion A. Preemption Although the Supremacy Clause 6 invalidates state laws that "interfere with, or are contrary to the laws of Congress," Gibbons v. Ogden , 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.)
1, 211 , 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824), the exercise of federal supremacy is not lightly to be presumed.
See Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc. , 451 U.S. 504, 522 , 101 S.Ct. 1895, 1905-06 , 68 L.Ed.2d 402 (1981); New York State Dep't of Social Servs.
v. Dublino , 413 U.S. 405, 413 , 93 S.Ct. 2507, 2513 , 37 L.Ed.2d 688 (1973).
In deciding whether a federal law preempts a state statute, the court's task "is to ascertain Congress' intent in enacting the federal statute at issue."
Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc. , 463 U.S. 85, 95 , 103 S.Ct. 2890, 2899 , 77 L.Ed.2d 490 (1983).
Preemption "may be either express or implied, and [it] 'is compelled whether Congress' command is explicitly stated in the statute's language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.'"

Legislative History Congress expressly provided in section 514(a) of ERISA for federal preemption of all state laws that "relate to" ERISA-covered plans.

7 Similarly, the House Committee [**213] on Education and Labor observed that "it is evident that the operations of employee benefit plans are increasingly interstate.
The uniformity of decision which the Act is designed to foster will help administrators, fiduciaries and participants to predict the legality of proposed actions without the necessity of reference to varying laws."

8 Although both the House and Senate recognized the need for broad federal preemption in the area of employee benefit plans, the original bills contained preemption language significantly narrower than the version ultimately adopted by Congress.
The earlier Senate version provided only for the preemption of all state laws that "relate to the subject matters regulated by this Act or the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act."

Judicial Interpretation Section 514(a) "is conspicuous for its breadth.
It establishes as an area of exclusive federal concern the subject of every state law that 'relate[s] to' an employee benefit plan governed by ERISA."
FMC Corp. v. Holliday , U.S. , 111 S.Ct. 403, 407 , 112 L.Ed.2d 356 (1990).
A law relates to an employee benefit plan, "in the normal sense of the phrase, if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan."
Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc. , 463 U.S. 85, 97 , 103 S.Ct. 2890, 2900 (1983); Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts , 471 U.S. 724, 739 , 105 S.Ct. 2380, 2389 (1985).
Under this common-sense meaning of the words, "a state law may 'relate to' a benefit plan, and thereby be pre-empted, even if the law is not specifically [**214] designed to affect such plans, or the effect is only indirect."
Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon , U.S. , 111 S.Ct. 478, 483 , 112 L.Ed.2d 474 (1990).
While it is true that "[s]ome state actions may affect employee benefit plans in too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner to warrant a finding that the law 'relates to' the plan," Shaw , 463 U.S. at 100 n. 21, 103 S.Ct. at 2901 n. 21, the Supreme Court has concluded "that state laws which make 'reference to' ERISA plans are laws that 'relate to' those plans within the meaning of 514(a) ."
Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Serv., Inc. , 486 U.S. 825, 829 , 108 S.Ct. 2182, 2185 , 100 L.Ed.2d 836 (1988) (holding that state law relates to ERISA-covered plan when it provides that plans subject to the provisions of ERISA shall not be subject to the process of garnishment); Metropolitan Life , 471 U.S. at 739 , 105 S.Ct. at 2389 (holding that state law relates to ERISA-covered plan when it requires all benefit plans to purchase specified mental-health benefits when they purchase a certain common insurance policy).
13 A conclusion that a law "relates to" an ERISA-covered plan does not end the preemption inquiry, however.
Once a court determines that section 514(a) has been satisfied, it must then check to see whether the law is nonetheless exempt from preemption under section 514(b) .
See Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux , 481 U.S. 41, 48 , 107 S.Ct. 1549, 1553 , 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987).
Only if the law does not qualify for an exemption from preemption under section 514(b) is it correct to conclude that the law which "relates to" an ERISA plan is preempted.
14 B. The District Court's Decision The district court in this case concluded that the Equity Amendment Act "relates to" an ERISA-covered employee benefit plan "because benefits under the Act are set by reference to covered employee benefit plans."
Memorandum Opinion at 3.
Indeed, appellees do not dispute that the Equity Amendment Act "relates to" an ERISA-covered employee benefit plan.
15 The district court implicitly recognized that the Equity Amendment Act relates, in fact, to two different plans: First, the Act "relates to" an ERISA-covered plan by requiring that the new benefits be "equivalent" to those already provided under an existing covered plan and by defining the employers who are obliged to provide the new benefits as those who already provide benefits under a covered plan.
Second, by requiring new benefits to be provided to employees who have been injured on the job, the Act "relates to" a workers' compensation plan that is, by virtue of the exemption for such plans under section 4(b)(3) , exempt from ERISA coverage.
So, the Act relates both to an ERISA-covered plan and to a plan that is exempt from ERISA coverage.
The district court relied on Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc. , 463 U.S. 85 , 103 S.Ct. 2890 , 77 L.Ed.2d 490 (1983), for the argument that because the Act related to a plan that was exempt from ERISA coverage, it was saved from preemption.
In Shaw , the Court considered whether New York's Disability Benefits Law was preempted by ERISA.
16 The Court found [**215] that where the law gives employers the option of establishing a separate benefit plan that is exempt from ERISA coverage under section 4(b) , such a law would not be preempted.
17 But the state law in Shaw related only to an employee disability insurance plan.
Relying on the earlier case of Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc. , 451 U.S. 504, 523 n. 20, 101 S.Ct. 1895, 1906 n. 20, 68 L.Ed.2d 402 (1981), the Court in Shaw concluded that where a law relates to a plan that is explicitly exempt from ERISA coverage under section 4(b) --as are all plans maintained solely to comply with disability insurance (and workers' compensation) laws--that law is not preempted.
But in our case, as we have already observed, the Equity Amendment Act relates to two plans--one that is ERISA covered and one that is exempt from ERISA coverage.
Had the Equity Amendment Act related only to the workers' compensation plan--had it, for example, made no reference to existing ERISA-covered plans and simply required all employers to provide specified minimum health benefits for employees receiving workers' compensation--it would clearly have survived preemption under the principles announced in Shaw .
The key issue in distinguishing Shaw from this case is that the Court in Shaw never found that the New York Disability Benefits Law related to an ERISA-covered plan.
The Court did find that the Disability Benefits Law plainly related to an "employee benefit plan," Shaw , 463 U.S. at 106 , 103 S.Ct. at 2904 , but a law is preempted under section 514(a) only if it relates to an employee benefit plan that is not exempt .
The plan to which the New York Disability Benefits Law related was exempt, so the law did not even qualify at the threshold for preemption.
Shaw would have governed this case had the Equity Amendment Act related only to the exempt plan; in that case, the Act would not have been preempted.
But Shaw does not tell us why an Act that relates to an ERISA-covered plan can avoid preemption simply because it also relates to a plan exempt from ERISA coverage.
Not only is there no authority in Shaw for this proposition, but it is entirely at odds with ERISA's statutory structure.
Once it is determined that a state law "relates to" an employee benefit plan covered by ERISA, the only escape from preemption is by way of the exemption provisions contained in section 514(b) .
But no one suggests that the Equity Amendment Act is a criminal law or one regulating insurance, banking, or securities.
In purporting to find the source of the exemption to preemption in section 4(b) , the district court has misconstrued the statutory scheme.
Section 514(a) preempts all state laws that "relate to any employee benefit plan described in section 4(a) and not exempt under section 4(b) ," ERISA 514(a) (codified at 29 U.S.C. 1144(a) (1988)).
Section 4 is the section defining the scope of ERISA coverage.
ERISA covers all employee benefit plans (as they are broadly defined in section 4(a) ) with the limited exception of the plans explicitly enumerated in section 4(b) .
The phrase "and not exempt under section 4(b) " is not like the laws described in section 514(b) ; it is not an exemption to preemption but rather part of the definition of an ERISA-covered plan.
In other words, when section 514(a) preempts all laws relating to "employee benefit plans described in section 4(a) and not exempt under section 4(b) ," it means that it is preempting all laws relating to [**216] employee benefit plans covered by ERISA.
18 In upholding the Equity Amendment Act, the district court reached the same conclusion as that of the Second Circuit in R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. v. Prevost , 915 F.2d 787 (2d Cir.1990), cert. denied , U.S. , 111 S.Ct. 1415 , 113 L.Ed.2d 468 (1991).
In Donnelley , the court considered the question of whether a virtually identical state workers' compensation law was preempted under ERISA, and it held that the statute was not preempted.
19 The Donnelley court distinguished its prior decision in Stone & Webster Engineering Corp. v. Ilsley , 690 F.2d 323 (2d Cir.1982), aff'd mem. sub nom.
Arcudi v. Stone & Webster Engineering Corp. , 463 U.S. 1220 , 103 S.Ct. 3564 , 77 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1983), which had held that an earlier statute was preempted because it had required employers to extend coverage under their existing health plan to employees receiving workers' compensation payments.
20 In contrast, the statute held not to be preempted in Donnelley permitted employers to provide the new coverage through separate plans administered independently from existing ERISA plans.
In distinguishing Stone & Webster , the Donnelley court relied on Shaw .
But the Second Circuit focused on only half the story.
By concentrating on how and in what ways the new workers' compensation plans would be exempt from ERISA coverage, the court failed to appreciate the fact that the Connecticut statute (like the Equity Amendment Act in this case) related to an ERISA-covered plan by tying the new benefits to existing benefits and by limiting the law's applicability to employers already providing benefits through ERISA plans.
21 The statute at issue in Donnelley is indistinguishable from the Equity Amendment Act.
22 Based on a plain reading of ERISA, we disagree [**217] with the conclusion of the Second Circuit in Donnelley and conclude that the district court in this case erred in holding that the Equity Amendment Act was not preempted.
C. Policy and Purpose Not only do the plain meaning and structure of ERISA itself require the conclusion that the Equity Amendment Act is preempted, but this result also furthers the broad purposes of ERISA preemption.
As the Supreme Court has explained, Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne , 482 U.S. 1, 11 , 107 S.Ct. 2211, 2217 , 96 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987).
23 This concern for minimizing the burden on the administration of ERISA-covered plans is reflected in the decision of the Court in Shaw , where it held that the Disability Benefits Law could not be enforced to the extent that it applied to benefits provided under a multibenefit plan: "An employer with employees in several States would find its plan subject to a different jurisdictional pattern of regulation in each State, depending on what benefits the State mandated under disability, work[ers'] compensation, and unemployment compensation laws."
Shaw , 463 U.S. at 107 , 103 S.Ct. at 2905 .
Appellees insist that the Equity Amendment Act would not impose any of these administrative burdens because it allows for the provision of health benefits through a separate plan that employers could administer independently of their ERISA-covered plans.
But appellees may underestimate the burden imposed.
While it is certainly true that the Equity Amendment Act does not require employers to alter ERISA-covered plans, it explicitly ties the benefit levels of the workers' compensation plan to those of the ERISA-covered plan.
In contrast to general state statutes that have only an incidental effect on the administration of ERISA plans, see, e.g. , Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Serv., Inc. , 486 U.S. 825 , 108 S.Ct. 2182 , 100 L.Ed.2d 836 (1988) (holding that state's garnishment statute is not preempted by ERISA), 24 the Equity Amendment Act could have a serious impact on the administration and content of the ERISA-covered plan.
The fact that the benefits to be provided to an employee receiving workers' compensation will be equivalent to the benefit levels provided while the employee is fully employed means that every time an employer considers changing the benefits under its ERISA-covered plan, it would have to consider the effect that such a change would have on its unique obligations to its District employees receiving workers' compensation.
25 In light of the additional financial burden associated with an increase in ERISA health benefits, an employer might choose to forego such an increase altogether.
This could have a substantial effect on the administration of an ERISA-covered plan.
As the Court emphasized in Fort Halifax , the central concern of the ERISA preemption provision is to avoid subjecting ERISA-covered plans to various and differing [**218] state regulations.
Fort Halifax , 482 U.S. at 9 , 107 S.Ct. at 2216 .
In trying to avoid the obvious preemption problem with requiring employers to extend their existing ERISA plans to employees receiving workers' compensation, see Stone & Webster Engineering Corp. v. Ilsley , 690 F.2d 323 (2d Cir.1982), aff'd mem. sub nom.
Arcudi v. Stone & Webster Engineering Corp. , 463 U.S. 1220 , 103 S.Ct. 3564 , 77 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1983), appellees have now tried to regulate indirectly what they were forbidden to regulate directly.
By requiring employers to take into account the effects that any general decisions about ERISA benefits would have on their responsibilities to their injured employees in the District of Columbia, the District has inevitably affected the administration of an ERISA plan.
But even if it were true that the administration of the ERISA plan would be unaffected by the operation of the Equity Amendment Act, ERISA does not only preempt laws which have such an administrative effect.
In Standard Oil Co. v. Agsalud , 633 F.2d 760 (9th Cir.1980), aff'd mem. , 454 U.S. 801 , 102 S.Ct. 79 , 70 L.Ed.2d 75 (1981), the court affirmed the district court's holding that Hawaii's Prepaid Health Care Act ("Hawaii Act"), H AW.
R EV.
S TAT. 393-1 to -51 (1976), 26 was preempted by ERISA: Agsalud , 633 F.2d at 765 .
27 The Court made the same observation in Fort Halifax : Fort Halifax , 482 U.S. at 13 n. 8, 107 S.Ct. at 2218 n. 8.
It is, of course, evident that many different kinds of state laws may affect an employer's decisions concerning the scope and content of its benefit plans.
Congress could have decided to preempt all state laws that "might conceivably have an effect upon" ERISA-covered employee benefit plans, but it chose to draw the line elsewhere.
It required that the law specifically "relate to" the ERISA-covered plan- i.e. , that it have "a connection with or reference to such a plan."
Shaw , 463 U.S. at 97 , 103 S.Ct. at 2900 .
This provision may preempt more than appellees would like, but to the extent that it does, their argument is with Congress and not with us.
III.
Conclusion For the reasons stated above, the decision of the district court is reversed, and [**219] the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.
It is so ordered .
