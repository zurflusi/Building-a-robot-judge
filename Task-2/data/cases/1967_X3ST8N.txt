 COLEMAN , Circuit Judge.
Appellant was charged with a violation of 26 U.S.C.A. 5851, 1 as follows: He moved to dismiss on the ground that "Section 5851, of Title 28, United States Code, which charges an offense with respect to Section 5841 2 is unconstitutional *."
The motion was overruled.
Haynes thereupon pleaded guilty, was sentenced to four years imprisonment, and has perfected this appeal.
A guilty plea is a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects and defenses and admits the facts charged, White v. Beto , 5 Cir., 1966, 367 F.2d 557 ; Law v. Beto , 5 Cir., 1966, 370 F.2d 369 .
Where, prior to his guilty plea, a defendant appropriately raises the unconstitutionality of the applicable statute, an appeal, directed to that issue, is not foreclosed, Ex Parte Siebold , 100 U.S. 371 , 25 L.Ed. 717 (1879); Rice v. United States , 5 Cir., 1929, 30 F.2d 681 ; United States v. Ury , 2 Cir., 1939, 106 F.2d 28 , 124 A.L.R. 569.
Insofar as it requires an individual to incriminate himself, Section 5841 has at least four times been held unconstitutional.
3 This Court aligned itself with those decisions in Lovelace v. United States , 357 F.2d 306 (1966).
We there held invalid an indictment which charged the possession of a sawed off shotgun "which had not been registered by the defendant ".
We said: also the failure to register by the defendant himself 357 F.2d at 309 The Court discussed the Russell case, cited in footnote 3, as to the unconstitutionality of Section 5841 and made known its familiarity with cases holding Section 5851 to be Constitutional.
The Constitutionality of Section 5851, however, was not expressly passed upon as that was unnecessary to the determination of the issue under consideration.
The appellant here, enjoying the vigorous assistance of able appointed counsel, strongly attacks the Constitutionality of Section 5851.
He argues that the Section cannot stand because it is inseparable from Section 5841, and, in any event, violates the privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.
As to the first ground, we quote from appellant's brief: As to the second ground, appellant says " nonregistration by 'any one' must, by the very provisions of Section 5841, necessarily include the present possessor of the firearm".
These arguments are not bereft of plausibility.
Nevertheless, it cannot be ignored that Section 5851 has at least eight times been held Constitutional.
4 We have been cited, and we find, no case to the contrary.
We are presented no issue of choice as to the weight of authority--the decisions all sustain Constitutionality.
In one of the most recent decisions collated in Footnote 4, Castellano v. United States, on which certiorari was denied, the Court held as follows: The judgment of the District Court is Affirmed.
