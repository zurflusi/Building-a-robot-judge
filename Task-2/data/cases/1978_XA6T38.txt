 PER CURIAM: These Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. 901-950 (1970) (amended 1972), cases 1 are on remand from the Supreme Court with instructions to reconsider them in light of Northeast Marine Terminal Co., Inc. v. Caputo , 432 U.S. 249 , 97 S.Ct. 2348 , 53 L.Ed.2d 320 (1977).
We find that our prior resolution of the coverage issues presented in each of these cases is consistent with the rationale expressed in Caputo , and, accordingly, we reaffirm our prior determinations as to the benefit eligibility of the affected maritime employees under the Act.
