 PER CURIAM: This is an appeal pro se from an order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Mark A. Costantino, Judge , denying appellant Alphonse Bifulco's motion for relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2255 .
We regard appellant's two claims on appeal as meritless and we affirm the order entered below.
Appellant was indicted on three drug-related counts, one count charging him under 21 U.S.C. 846 with conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and possess with intent to distribute substantial quantities of phencyclidine, a Schedule III controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) , and the other two counts charging him with substantive violations of 841(a)(1) .
After a jury trial, appellant was convicted on the conspiracy charge and acquitted on the substantive charges.
On June 3, 1977, he was sentenced to four years' imprisonment, a special parole term of five years and a $1,000 fine.
This Court affirmed his conviction without opinion on December 15, 1977.
Subsequently appellant, pro se , moved to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. 2255 .
The motion was denied by the district court and this appeal followed.
Appellant presents two claims for our consideration.
The gist of the first argument is that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his trial and conviction on the conspiracy count, in the absence of evidence proving a substantive offense as the object of the conspiracy, on the theory that no offense against the United States had been proven.
As this argument attacks the jurisdiction of the trial court, we will overlook appellant's failure to raise this objection in the 2255 motion presented to the district court.
Reaching the merits, we must reject appellant's argument as utterly without foundation.
Congress explicitly defined conspiracy under 846 , standing alone, as a federal crime.
A defendant need not be charged with any other violation in order to be tried and convicted under 846 .
See, e.g. , United States v. Lyles , 593 F.2d 182 (2d Cir.), cert. denied , U.S. , 99 S.Ct. 1537 , 59 L.Ed.2d 789 (1979).
Moreover, a defendant charged with both a 846 conspiracy and a substantive violation of 841 may be lawfully convicted on the former and acquitted on the latter.
See, e. g. , United States v. Lubrano , 529 F.2d 633 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied , 429 U.S. 818 , 97 S.Ct. 61 , 50 L.Ed.2d 78 (1976).
See generally Callanan v. United States , 364 U.S. 587 , 81 S.Ct. 321 , 5 L.Ed.2d 312 (1961) (noting distinctiveness of conspiracy to commit a particular offense and actual commission of that offense).
Appellant's second contention, which was raised below, is that the imposition on him of a special parole term, in addition to incarceration, is an impermissible expansion of the sentencing provisions of 21 U.S.C. 846 .
We disagree.
Section 846 provides: imprisonment or fine or both maximum punishment (emphasis added).
Appellant argues in his brief that the "maximum punishment" spelled out in 846 refers to the maximum imprisonment or fine prescribed for violations of the substantive offenses covered by 21 U.S.C. 841(b) .
He claims that the legislative history demonstrates a congressional intent to exclude the special parole mandated by 21 U.S.C. 841(b) .
Therefore, he reasons, the addition of a period of special parole to his sentence of imprisonment and fine was an illegal sentence under 21 U.S.C. 846 .
The only authority we have found that supports appellant's interpretation of the sentencing provisions of 846 is Fassette v. United States , 444 F.Supp.
1245 (C.D.Cal.1978).
The Fassette court interpreted 846 as "not permitting all of the types and kinds of punishment prescribed for the substantive offense but permitting only fine and imprisonment which shall not exceed the maximum fine and imprisonment prescribed for the substantive offense."
Id. at 1247 (footnote omitted).
The court's expressed hope that the Ninth Circuit would rule on the issue, id. at 1248 , has gone unfulfilled.
The weight of authority is to the contrary.
In United States v. Armedo-Sarmiento , 545 F.2d 785, 794-95 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. denied , 430 U.S. 917 , 97 S.Ct. 1330 , 51 L.Ed.2d 595 (1977), and United States v. Wiley , 519 F.2d 1348, 1351 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied , 423 U.S. 1058 , 96 S.Ct. 793 , 46 L.Ed.2d 648 (1976), we gave our implicit approval to the type of sentencing challenged here without discussing or ruling on the claim raised by the appellant here.
The Fifth Circuit in United States v. De La Fuente , 550 F.2d 309 (5th Cir. 1977), similarly gave its tacit approval to a sentence containing a special parole term for a violation of 846 without considering the argument proffered here.
In addition, the two circuit courts that have directly addressed this issue have both rejected the reasoning adopted in Fassette and urged upon us here by appellant.
In United States v. Burman , 584 F.2d 1354, 1358 (4th Cir. 1978), the court stated: 846 846 841(b) 846 841(b) 846 The Tenth Circuit relied on a similar analysis in rejecting the interpretation pressed here by the appellant: 841(b) 841(b) Section 841(c) 846 841(b) United States v. Jacobson , 578 F.2d 863, 868 (10th Cir. 1978).
We note too that in a closely analogous case, United States v. Dankert , 507 F.2d 190 (5th Cir. 1975), the Fifth Circuit upheld the imposition of a special parole term in addition to imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. 963 .
Section 963 prohibits conspiracy to import, rather than manufacture, controlled substances; the corresponding substantive sections, 952(a)(1) and 960(b)(1), punish the actual importation of these substances, and as such, they are companion sections to the substantive offense section involved in the instant appeal.
In Dankert the appellant made the argument, similar to that advanced by appellant Bifulco, that 963 does not include the special parole term provision of 960(b)(2) .
Section 963 provides: imprisonment or fine or both maximum punishment (emphasis added).
The Dankert Court rejected the interpretation proffered by appellant: 963 952(a) 952(a) 960(a)(1) section 952 960(b)(1) 963 952(a) Id. at 191 .
We agree with the position taken by the Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Circuits on this issue.
Therefore, we affirm the order of the district court denying appellant's 2255 motion.
