 BONSAL , District Judge: The American Medical Association ("AMA"), the Connecticut State Medical Society ("CSMS"), and the New Haven County Medical Association, Inc. ("NHCMA") petition for review of a Cease and Desist Order issued by the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") against AMA on October 12, 1979 (FTC Dkt.
No. 9064).
The Order requires AMA to cease and desist from promulgating, implementing, and enforcing restraints on advertising, solicitation, and contract practices by physicians and on the contractual arrangements between physicians and non-physicians.
The FTC found that ethical standards issued by AMA were in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1) .
The FTC cross-petitions for enforcement of its Order.
THE FACTS AMA is an Illinois not-for-profit corporation first incorporated in 1897.
Its membership is comprised of physicians, osteopaths and medical students, but most of its members are practicing physicians.
As of December 31, 1974, 52.6% of the licensed physicians in the United States were members of AMA.
AMA's legislative body is its House of Delegates.
Enactments of the House of Delegates become the official policy of AMA.
In 1957 the House of Delegates approved the "Principles of Medical Ethics" consisting of a preamble and ten paragraphs.
1 Interpretation of the "Principles of Medical Ethics" is made by AMA's Judicial Council, a committee of the House of Delegates, and the decisions of the Judicial Council are set forth in the AMA publication, Opinions and Reports .
The Judicial Council also is responsible for reviewing adjudications of state societies.
CSMS is the state medical society in Connecticut.
A number of state medical societies originally formed AMA and membership in a state medical society is a condition to membership in AMA.
82% of Connecticut physicians are members of CSMS.
NHCMA is a local medical association.
71% of New Haven physicians are members of NHCMA.
A New Haven physician must be a member of NHCMA in order to become a member of CSMS.
On December 19, 1975, the FTC filed a complaint against AMA, CSMS, and NHCMA charging them with restricting the ability of their members to advertise for and solicit patients and with interfering with the ability of their members to engage in contractual relationships with non-physicians.
CSMS and NHCMA were included in the complaint on the ground that the state societies and local associations follow the lead of AMA and because the FTC believed that there was a conspiracy between AMA and the state societies and local associations to restrict competition among physicians through ethical limitations on advertising, solicitation and contractual relationships.
Such restriction, in the view of the FTC, violated Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.
The FTC held hearings between September 7, 1977 and May 5, 1978.
On November 13, 1978, the administrative law judge, Ernest G. Barnes, issued his Initial Decision finding that the ethical practices complained of violated Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.
On appeal of the administrative law judge's decision to the FTC, the Commission affirmed and issued its Opinion and Final Order on October 12, 1979 (FTC Dkt.
No. 9064) ("FTC Opinion").
The Final Order requires AMA to cease and desist from promulgating, implementing and enforcing restraints on advertising, solicitation and contract practices by physicians and on the contractual arrangements between physicians and non-physicians.
Exception is made with respect to "false or deceptive" practices, and the Order provides that nothing contained therein prohibits AMA from Section 5 The Order also requires AMA to disassociate itself from any state or local society that violates the terms of the Order.
PRELIMINARY ISSUES Two preliminary issues have been raised by the petitioners: 2 (1) that the FTC lacks jurisdiction over the petitioners, and (2) that Chairman Michael Pertschuk should have been disqualified because he had demonstrated through his public statements that he had prejudged key issues in the proceeding.
3 Jurisdiction over Petitioners Petitioners contend that as nonprofit corporations, they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the FTC as set forth in Section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 44 , which defines "corporation" to include any entity "organized to carry on business for its own profit or that of its members."
The record satisfies us that the petitioners serve both the business and non-business interests of their member physicians.
As long ago as 1902, AMA amended its Articles of Incorporation to provide that one of its objectives was to "safeguard the material interests of the medical profession."
The administrative law judge found that AMA actively lobbies for legislation that it believes may be for the profit of its members.
He also found that AMA, in a variety of ways, including advice on insurance plans, renders business advice to its members.
The business aspects of the activities of the petitioners fall within the scope of the Federal Trade Commission Act even if they are considered secondary to the charitable and social aspects of their work.
See Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar , 421 U.S. 773, 788 , 95 S.Ct. 2004, 2013-14 , 44 L.Ed.2d 572 (1975); FTC v. National Commission on Egg Nutrition , 517 F.2d 485, 488 (7th Cir. 1975), cert. denied , 426 U.S. 919 , 96 S.Ct. 2623 , 49 L.Ed.2d 372 (1976).
Petitioners' reliance upon Community Blood Bank of Kansas City Area, Inc. v. FTC , 405 F.2d 1011 (8th Cir. 1969), is misplaced.
That case involved a blood bank run as a charitable organization.
However, the court recognized that "Congress did not intend to provide a blanket exclusion of all non-profit corporations " Id. at 1017 .
The FTC fully considered the facts bearing on whether the petitioners' activities included their business aspects.
See FTC v. Ernstthal , 607 F.2d 488, 490 (D.C.Cir.1979).
In addition, the Cease and Desist Order involves only advertising, solicitation and contractual relationships.
We therefore conclude that the evidence in the record sustains the jurisdiction of the FTC.
Disqualification of Chairman Pertschuk During the FTC proceeding, the petitioners moved to disqualify Chairman Pertschuk on the ground that he had prejudged the merits of this proceeding before it came before the Commission.
In support of this contention, petitioners cite a speech made by Chairman Pertschuk before the American Enterprise Institute's Occupational Licensure Conference on February 22, 1979 concerning the misuse of licensing procedures to restrain competition.
However, no mention of this case was made, nor was there any reference to physicians as a group.
Chairman Pertschuk prepared a statement for presentation to the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research, of the United States Senate, on October 10, 1977, which was never presented because of the cancellation of the hearings.
This statement discussed the medical profession in the context of a multitude of issues in the field of health care.
The lone reference to this proceeding was that a complaint had been filed challenging portions of the Code of Ethics of AMA that "may" unduly restrain dissemination of information about physicians' services.
He stated that "[s]ince these matters are currently in litigation, I hope you will understand why it would not be appropriate for me to comment further about them."
Petitioners also refer to a speech made by Chairman Pertschuk before the Consumer Assembly on January 19, 1978 with respect to food and health care costs.
He mentioned the trial of this case as one of the many activities being undertaken by the FTC in the medical care field.
We do not find that Chairman Pertschuk's statements on these occasions, considered in their entirety, Kennecott Copper Corp. v. FTC , 467 F.2d 67, 80 (10th Cir. 1972), cert. denied , 416 U.S. 909 , 94 S.Ct. 1617 , 40 L.Ed.2d 114 (1974), approach the appearance of impropriety, the test applied in Cinderella Career and Finishing Schools, Inc. v. FTC , 425 F.2d 583, 590-91 (D.C.Cir.1970).
4 Nor do we find that Chairman Pertschuk prejudged the facts and the law in this case before hearing it.
Gilligan, Will & Co. v. SEC , 267 F.2d 461, 468 (2d Cir.), cert. denied , 361 U.S. 896 , 80 S.Ct. 200 , 4 L.Ed.2d 152 (1959).
At most, the public statements brought to our attention by the petitioners indicate that the chairman was informing the Congress and the public as to FTC's activities and policies in general, FTC v. Cement Institute , 333 U.S. 683, 700-01 , 68 S.Ct. 793, 803 , 92 L.Ed. 1010 (1948), including those in the medical field.
We do not find these statements to be grounds for disqualification.
LIABILITY At the time the FTC filed its complaint in this action on December 19, 1975, AMA's authoritative interpretation of the ethical restraints that are the subject of this action were contained in the 1971 edition of Opinions and Reports .
5 Both the administrative law judge and the Commission detailed numerous examples of applications of the ethical restraints evidencing an anticompetitive purpose and effect.
These included restrictions upon the dissemination of price information, bans upon advertisement of individual physicians' services and alternative forms of medical care, and restraints upon particular forms of advertising.
The Commission concluded that this evidence "is susceptible to no interpretation other than that ethical principles of the medical profession have prevented doctors and medical organizations from disseminating information on the prices and services they offer, severely inhibiting competition among health care providers."
FTC Opinion, at 29.
The Commission further found that AMA's contract practice restrictions had the purpose and effect of restraining competition by group health plans, hospitals, and similar organizations, and restricted physicians from developing business structures of their own choice.
Id. at 41-43 .
Based upon our own review of the record, we conclude that these findings are supported by substantial evidence.
See 15 U.S.C. 45(c) .
Petitioners contend that the ethical guidelines are merely to assist the state societies and the local associations; in other words, that they are advisory only.
They point out that no formal action has been taken by AMA in these matters since 1955 in the appeal of Ben E. Landess where Dr. Landess was charged with "the indirect solicitation and procurement of patients by advertising."
Dr. Landess was the Medical Director of the Jamaica Medical Group, which had a contract with the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, Inc. ("H.I.
P."), which offers a form of prepaid medical coverage in the State of New York.
H.I.P.
advertises directly to the public.
The Judicial Council of AMA adopted the report of the Queens County Medical Society that no action be taken against Dr. Landess.
The Judicial Council went on to say that since the quality of its advertising is not in issue and "since Dr. Landess had nothing to do with the preparation or distribution of the advertising, it is our opinion contrary to that of the state and county medical societies that the conduct of Dr. Landess does not violate the ethic relating to solicitation and advertising."
Joint App. at 425.
In any event, the issue here is not whether AMA has specific power or authority over the state societies and local associations or, if it has, whether it exercises it.
The issue is whether these groups have acted in concert to effectuate restraints on advertising and solicitation in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act.
It is this concerted activity for a common purpose that constitutes the violation.
FTC v. Cement Institute , 333 U.S. at 709 , 68 S.Ct. at 807 .
See National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States , 435 U.S. 679, 692-96 , 98 S.Ct. 1355, 1365-68 , 55 L.Ed.2d 637 (1978).
The record satisfies us that AMA intended and expected that the state and local medical groups would enforce the limitations on advertising and solicitation and, indeed, advised them as to how to do it.
In other words, AMA limitations "provided the impetus" for the actions taken, and individual physicians "could be expected to comply in order to assure that they did not discredit themselves by departing from professional norms, and perhaps betraying their professional oaths."
Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar , 421 U.S. at 791 n.21, 95 S.Ct. at 2015 .
REMEDY The Final Order of the Commission consists of six Parts, the first two being the Cease and Desist Orders, and the third and fourth being the notice and disaffiliation provisions.
The Final Order is directed only to AMA, and not to CSMS or NHCMA.
Part I of the Order directs AMA to cease and desist from (A) restricting the advertising of services, facilities, or prices by physicians or organizations with which physicians are affiliated; (B) restricting the operation of any organization that offers physicians' services to the public, by means of representations concerning the ethical propriety of medical service arrangements that limit the patients' choice of a physician; and (C) inducing any physician or nongovernmental medical organization to take any of the prohibited restrictive actions.
Part I expressly excludes from its prohibitions the dissemination by AMA of reasonable ethical guidelines concerning false and deceptive advertising and solicitation.
Part II of the Order directs AMA to cease and desist from (A) restricting or interfering with the consideration offered or provided physicians in return for the sale or distribution of their professional services; (B) restricting any organization that offers physicians' services by means of representations concerning the ethical propriety of medical service arrangements that limit the patients' choice of a physician; (C) restricting participation by non-physicians in the ownership or management of such organizations; and (D) inducing physicians or any organization from taking any of the actions prohibited by Part II.
Part III of the Order requires AMA in any proceeding involving violations of its ethical standards to provide (A) reasonable notice, (B) a hearing, and (C) written findings and conclusions.
Part IV of the Order requires AMA to (A) give written notice of the Order to its members and affiliate societies; (B) provide all new members and affiliate societies with a copy of the Order for a period of ten years; (C) remove from all of its publications and policy statements any provisions inconsistent with the Order; (D) require that all affiliate organizations, as a condition of affiliation, agree to adhere to the Order; and (E) disaffiliate for one year any constituent organization that engages in any act or practice prohibited by the Order.
Post-Complaint Activities of AMA Petitioners contend that the revisions of the ethical standards contained in the 1977 Opinions and Reports obviate any need to enter the Order herein.
However, this does not constitute grounds for denying enforcement of an FTC order, see, e. g. , Fedders Corp. v. FTC , 529 F.2d 1398, 1403 (2d Cir.), cert. denied , 429 U.S. 818 , 97 S.Ct. 63 , 50 L.Ed.2d 79 (1976), especially since the publication of the revisions occurred "only after the filing of the FTC complaint."
Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. FTC , 557 F.2d 971, 988 (2d Cir. 1977) (emphasis in the original), rev'd on other grounds , 440 U.S. 69 , 99 S.Ct. 925 , 59 L.Ed.2d 153 (1979).
In any event, the Commission can properly find, as it did here, 6 that the revisions were insufficient.
Additionally, it is not clear that the 1977 revisions rescinded prior ethical standards.
7 AMA has never announced to its members or affiliate societies that the 1971 ethical standards are no longer in effect.
Moreover, nothing in the 1977 version of the Opinions and Reports indicates that it was intended to disavow prior standards.
Rather, it refers with approval to the "long standing policy of the Judicial Council on advertising and solicitation by physicians."
By referring to the established policies, AMA indicated that its positions may not have changed and that the restraints, "if abandoned at all, may be resumed."
FTC Opinion, at 57.
See SCM Corp. v. FTC , 565 F.2d 807, 813 (2d Cir. 1977).
8 Finally, it is well established law that it is within the discretion of the FTC to determine whether an order is "necessary to cope with the unfair practices found." FTC v. Colgate-Palmolive Co. , 380 U.S. 374, 392 , 85 S.Ct. 1035, 1046 , 13 L.Ed.2d 904 (1965).
9 We have determined that the FTC considered the changes and rationally assessed their significance in concluding that a cease and desist order was warranted.
See SCM Corp. v. FTC , 565 F.2d at 812 .
See also FTC v. National Lead Co. , 352 U.S. 419, 429 , 77 S.Ct. 502, 509 , 1 L.Ed.2d 438 (1957).
On July 22, 1980, AMA's House of Delegates adopted a new version of the Principles of Medical Ethics .
The most notable change is the removal of the ban on "solicitation" previously found in Section 5 of the Principles .
The 1980 Principles instead require a physician to deal "honestly," to expose doctors "deficient in character or competence," and "to respect the rights of other health professionals."
The elimination of the ban on solicitation which appeared in the 1957 version of the Principles reflects a significant and commendable effort to comply with the terms of the FTC order here under review.
AMA does not, however, concede any legal obligation to make such changes, since it still denies any involvement in the unlawful restraints found by the FTC.
The language of the 1980 Principles is general and imprecise in nature.
Moreover, the various written interpretations of the 1957 Principles previously promulgated by AMA remain in effect.
In the absence of any interpretation of the 1980 Principles in AMA's Opinions and Reports , we cannot find that the FTC's claims are moot.
First Amendment Petitioners contend that Part II of the Cease and Desist Order constitutes a prior restraint upon speech and impermissibly interferes with the right to freedom of association under the First Amendment.
We disagree.
The FTC determined that various restrictions which AMA imposed upon contract practices of physicians violated the FTC Act.
These included ethical restraints upon so-called "closed panel" arrangements, upon the consideration paid physicians by health care organizations, and upon physicians' arrangements with non-physicians.
By its terms, 10 the Order applies solely to "ethical" restraints, and thus does not affect any speech or other First Amendment rights except insofar as it applies to statements officially condemning contract practices.
"Just as an injunction against price fixing abridges the freedom of businessmen to talk to one another about prices, so too the injunction in this case must restrict [AMA's] range of expression on the ethics of [contract practices of physicians]."
National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States , 435 U.S. 679, 697 , 98 S.Ct. 1355, 1367 , 55 L.Ed.2d 637 (1978).
Cf. California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited , 404 U.S. 508, 513 , 92 S.Ct. 609, 613 , 30 L.Ed.2d 642 (1972) (right to freedom of association does not include the right to violate the law).
Overbreadth and Vagueness Petitioners assert that the proviso at the end of Part I, which permits AMA to adopt "reasonable ethical guidelines governing the conduct of its members with respect to representations, including unsubstantiated representations, that would be false or deceptive within the meaning of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act," is overbroad and vague.
The proviso was inserted in the Final Order at the request of AMA because of the Commission's "conviction that the AMA has a valuable and unique role to play with respect to deceptive advertising and oppressive forms of solicitation by physicians."
FTC Opinion, at 58.
AMA asks that it be granted more leeway in determining what kinds of claims are deceptive and misleading without the chilling effect that the threat of fines and penalties could have on its regulation of false and deceptive advertising.
The Commission recognizes the "'special role' of organized medicine [that] necessarily confers on AMA a measure of discretion to develop 'principles of conduct.'"
FTC Brief at 109, quoting Bates v. State Bar of Arizona , 433 U.S. 350, 384 , 97 S.Ct. 2691, 2709 , 53 L.Ed.2d 810 (1977).
In view of the foregoing, we will amend the proviso by inserting the words "respondent reasonably believes" so that the concluding paragraph of Part I will read as follows: respondent reasonably believes Section 5 11 Additionally, petitioners contend that Part II-A of the Order requires AMA to cease and desist from "advising on the ethical propriety of, or interfering with the consideration offered or provided to any physician in return for the sale, purchase or distribution of his or her professional services."
AMA points out that this provision is so broad as to impinge upon valid activity such as professional peer review of the fee practices of physicians.
In apparent recognition of this and mindful of Judge Wisdom's caveat that an FTC order "should not be drawn so broadly that it will cover legitimate practices," Cotherman v. FTC , 417 F.2d 587, 596 (5th Cir. 1969), the Commission requests us to modify clause II-A of the Order to add the words "in any contract with any entity that offers physicians' services to the public" following the word "physician."
This modification clarifies the meaning of the Order, especially in light of the administrative record herein.
See, e. g. , Trans World Accounts, Inc. v. FTC , 594 F.2d 212, 215 n.2 (9th Cir. 1979); National Commission on Egg Nutrition v. FTC , 570 F.2d 157 at 163 (7th Cir).
However, in view of AMA's contention in its reply brief that the Order is still overbroad, we will further modify the Order by adding the words "except for professional peer review of fee practices of physicians."
Thus, the clause, as modified, will read: in any contract with any entity that offers physicians' services to the public except for professional peer review of fee practices of physicians The Disaffiliation Provision Part IV of the Order requires AMA to disaffiliate for one year any state or local medical society that engages in acts or practices that would violate the Order if engaged in by AMA, and requires as a condition to affiliation that the state and local societies agree to adhere to the provision of the Order.
Petitioners contend that this violates due process.
However, this provision finds support in National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States , 435 U.S. at 697 , 98 S.Ct. at 1367 .
The Order does not violate AMA's right to due process since it bears a reasonable relationship to the unlawful practices found to exist.
See, e. g. , Jacob Siegel Co. v. FTC , 327 U.S. 608, 613 , 66 S.Ct. 758, 760 , 90 L.Ed. 888 (1946).
See also United States v. International Boxing Club of New York, Inc. , 171 F.Supp.
841, 842 (S.D.N.Y.1957), aff'd 358 U.S. 242, 245 , 79 S.Ct. 245, 247 , 3 L.Ed.2d 270 (1959).
The Commission "must be allowed effectively to close all roads to the prohibited goal, so that its orders may not be bypassed with impunity," FTC v. Ruberoid Co. , 343 U.S. 470, 473 , 72 S.Ct. 800, 803 , 96 L.Ed. 1081 (1952), by the state and local medical societies.
12 The Final Order of the FTC is MODIFIED as indicated herein.
As so modified, the Order is ENFORCED.
