 OPINION HOLSCHUH , District Judge.
Plaintiffs are seven health maintenance organizations (HMOs) licensed under the laws of Kentucky, and the Kentucky Association of Health Plans, Inc., a non-profit association organized to promote the business interest of its HMO members (hereinafter referred to as "plaintiffs").
Plaintiffs filed this action against George Nichols III ("defendant"), in his official capacity as Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Insurance.
Plaintiffs argued that Kentucky Revised Statutes Annotated 304.17A-110(3) and 304.17A-171(1)-(8) (Banks-Baldwin 1995), should be found preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), and sought injunctive relief from their enforcement.
Both parties moved for summary judgment.
The district court denied plaintiffs' request for summary judgment and granted defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment, concluding that 304.17A-110(3) and 304.17A-171(2) were saved from preemption by ERISA because they "regulated insurance" under ERISA's savings clause.
Plaintiffs assert that the district court erred in this conclusion.
I. The State Statutes In 1994, the Kentucky General Assembly enacted the Kentucky Health Care Reform Act (the "Act").
The Act contained an "Any Willing Provider" provision that stated: "Health care benefit plans shall not discriminate against any provider who is located within the geographic coverage area of the health benefit plan and is willing to meet the terms and conditions for participation established by the health benefit plan."
Ky.Rev.Stat.
Ann. 304.17A-110(3) (Banks-Baldwin 1995).
The Act defined a health benefit plan as: KRS 304.17A-160 304.17A-100 In 1996, the Kentucky General Assembly added 304.17A-170 and 171 to the code.
The additions specifically regulate how "health benefit plans" can interact with chiropractors.
1 Not only does the statute contain an "any willing provider" provision addressed particularly to chiropractors, 2 but it also imposes various additional requirements on health benefit plans that include chiropractic benefits.
3 See 304.17A-171 .
In April of 1997, plaintiffs filed suit in the Eastern District of Kentucky, requesting that 304.17A-110 (3) and 304.17A-171 (for convenience we will collectively refer to 304.17A-110 (3) and 304.17A-171 (2) as Kentucky's "AWP" laws) be declared, among other things, preempted by 514(a) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. 1144(a) .
Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on the issue and Commissioner Nichols cross-moved for partial summary judgment as well.
The district court determined that while the Kentucky AWP laws were related to employee benefit plans under ERISA 514(a) , they regulated the business of insurance and therefore fell under the saving clause of 514(b) , 29 U.S.C. 1144(b)(2)(A) .
The court thus granted partial summary judgment in favor of Commissioner Nichols and determined its order to be final and appealable.
This appeal followed.
Sections 304.17A-110 (3) and 304.17A-100(4)(a) were repealed by the Kentucky legislature effective July 1, 1999.
The parties acknowledge that this appeal is not moot, however, as the legislature, through House Bill No. 315 (Ky.1998), replaced the repealed provisions with the same requirements, but substituted the term "health insurer" for "health benefit plan" in its any willing provider provision, now located at Kentucky Revised Statutes Annotated 304.17A-270 (Banks-Baldwin 1999).
The Bill's definition of "insurer" was codified at Kentucky Revised Statutes Annotated 304.17A-005 (22) (Banks-Baldwin 1999), which defines "insurer" as: The parties having agreed that this appeal is not rendered moot by the new language used in the present statutes, the court will consider the AWP laws in their present form in the court's analysis of their validity, rather than adjudicating the validity of repealed statutes.
The chiropractic provisions contained in 304.17A-171 and 304.17A-170 were left intact by House Bill No. 315 and continue to remain unchanged.
The issue of the potential preemption of 304.17A-270 and 304.17A-171(2) by ERISA is therefore properly before this court.
4 We review a district court's decision to grant summary judgment de novo , applying the same test as that employed by the district court.
Wathen v. General Elec. Co. , 115 F.3d 400, 403 (6th Cir.1997).
Summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
See Schachner v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Ohio , 77 F.3d 889, 892-93 (6th Cir.1996).
II.
Preemption We are required by this appeal to define the boundaries of preemption under ERISA 514(a) and (b), 29 U.S.C. 1144(a) and (b).
Section 514(a) , the preemption provision, reads: relate to section 1003(a) section 1003(b) Section 514(b)(2) (A), the "savings" provision, reads: Section 514(b)(2) (B), the "deemer" provision, reads: section 1003(a) section 1003(b) The federal courts have addressed the scope of ERISA's preemption of State law on numerous occasions; however, the wording of the Act combined with the obvious federalism concerns involved have made it difficult to discern clear boundaries.
Many courts, including the Supreme Court, have commented on the vexingly broad and ambiguous nature of the provisions.
5 Despite such interpretational difficulties, we must determine whether Kentucky Revised Statutes Annotated 304.17A-270 and 304.17A-171(2) (Banks-Baldwin 1999) "relate to" employee benefit plans covered by ERISA.
If so, then the provisions are preempted, unless they fall under ERISA's saving clause as laws regulating insurance.
ERISA is a comprehensive act designed to regulate employee welfare and pension benefit plans, including those that provide "'medical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits' for plan participants or their beneficiaries 'through the purchase of insurance or otherwise.'"
New York State Conf.
of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co. , 514 U.S. 645, 650-51 , 115 S.Ct. 1671, 1674 , 131 L.Ed.2d 695, 702 (1995) (discussing and quoting ERISA 3(1) , 29 U.S.C. 1002(1) ).
To assure that the regulation of employee welfare benefits would remain an area of exclusive federal concern, Congress passed 514(a) of ERISA, the preemption provision.
The Supreme Court has specifically found that in passing 514(a) it was Congress' intent: Travelers , 514 U.S. at 656-57 , 115 S.Ct. at 1677 , 131 L.Ed.2d at 706 (alteration in original) (quoting Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon , 498 U.S. 133, 142 , 111 S.Ct. 478, 484 , 112 L.Ed.2d 474, 486 (1990)).
In discussing the preemption provision, the Court has variously noted its extreme breadth, terming it "clearly expansive," "broad [in] scope," "broadly worded," "deliberately expansive," and "conspicuous for its breadth."
California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N.A., Inc. , 519 U.S. 316, 324 , 117 S.Ct. 832, 837 , 136 L.Ed.2d 791, 799 (1997) (internal citations omitted) (reviewing past Supreme Court case law addressing the scope of ERISA's preemption provision).
The preemption provision, however, is not without limits.
As the Court noted in Travelers , 514(a) preempts all state laws that relate to an employee benefit plan covered by ERISA, but, "[i]f 'relate to' were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminancy, then for all practical purposes preemption would never run its course."
514 U.S. at 655 , 115 S.Ct. at 1677 , 131 L.Ed.2d at 705 .
Thus, to determine whether a law "relates to" an employee benefit plan, the Court has formulated a two part test, under which a "law 'relate[s] to' a covered employee benefit plan for purposes of 514(a) if it has a connection with or reference to such plan."
Dillingham , 519 U.S. at 324 , 117 S.Ct. at 837 , 136 L.Ed.2d at 799 (internal quotations and citations omitted) (emphasis added).
The district court found, and plaintiffs argue, that the Kentucky AWP provisions both refer to and have a connection with ERISA covered employee benefit plans.
6 We analyze each prong of the "relation to" test in turn.
A. Reference To The Supreme Court has provided guidance in several cases as to when a law "refers to" ERISA.
In Dillingham the Court summarized its analysis, stating: District of Columbia v. Washington Bd. of Trade 506 U.S. 125, 130-31 113 S.Ct. 580 121 L.Ed.2d 513 Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc. 486 U.S. 825, 828 108 S.Ct. 2182 100 L.Ed.2d 836 Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon 498 U.S. 133, 140 111 S.Ct. 478 112 L.Ed.2d 474 Mackey Greater Washington Bd. of Trade Ingersoll-Rand 519 U.S. at 324-25 , 117 S.Ct. at 837-38 , 136 L.Ed.2d at 799 .
In Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc. , 486 U.S. 825 , 108 S.Ct. 2182 , 100 L.Ed.2d 836 (1988), the Court discussed Georgia Code Annotated 18-4-22.1 (1982), which specifically exempted ERISA plans from Georgia's general garnishment law.
The Court noted that even though Georgia's legislature may have enacted 18-4-22.1 to help effectuate ERISA's underlying purpose, it would still be preempted if it fell within ERISA's preemption provision.
Finding that 18-4-22.1 was indeed preempted, the Court stated: Ga.Code Ann. 18-4-22.1 514(a) Mackey , 486 U.S. at 830 , 108 S.Ct. at 2186 , 100 L.Ed.2d at 844 .
In a footnote, the Court indicated that the "different treatment" was illustrated not just by the express reference to ERISA plans in the statute's language, but also in the disparate treatment accorded to non-ERISA pension and benefit plans under Georgia law.
See id .
at n. 4.
The effect was that only ERISA welfare benefit plans were singled out for protection under the statute, an impermissible result.
The district court in the case at bar relied on Mackey in determining whether Kentucky's AWP statutes referred to an ERISA plan.
The district court first observed that under Kentucky's statute, "health benefit plans" were defined to include, among other things, "a self-insured plan or plan provided by a multiple employer welfare arrangement, to the extent permitted by ERISA."
Based on this language, the court concluded that "it is clear that the AWP statutes 'refer to' ERISA employee benefit plans."
In support, the court cited De Buono v. NYSA-ILA Medical & Clinical Services Fund , 520 U.S. 806, 815 , 117 S.Ct. 1747, 1752 , 138 L.Ed.2d 21, 30 (1997), which cited Mackey for the principle that a provision that explicitly refers to ERISA in defining the scope of the state law's application is preempted.
The district court noted that the Western District of Kentucky in Community Health Partners, Inc. v. Kentucky , 14 F.Supp.2d 991 (W.D.Ky.1998), disagreed with its analysis of the same statute.
The Community Health Partners court, relying on language in Dillingham , found that Kentucky's AWP statute did not "refer to" an ERISA plan because the law did not act "immediately and exclusively upon ERISA plans" and because the existence of ERISA plans was not essential to the law's operation.
Id. at 995-96 .
However, the district court in the present case disagreed with the Community Health Partners court, finding that " Mackey makes it clear that when a statute 'singles out ERISA employee benefit plans for different treatment' the statute's 'express reference to ERISA plans suffices to bring it within the federal law's preemptive reach.'"
J.A.
at 12 n. 6.
Other courts have reached similar conclusions.
The Eighth Circuit in Prudential Insurance Co. of America v. National Park Medical Center, Inc. , 154 F.3d 812 (8th Cir.1998), found that an Arkansas AWP statute containing language comparable to Kentucky's provisions was preempted due to its reference to employee benefit plans covered by ERISA.
The court noted that the law expressly stated its provisions "shall not apply to self-funded or other health benefit plans that are exempt from state regulation by virtue of [ERISA]."
Id. at 822 .
Accordingly, the court determined that 23-99-209 of the Arkansas Patient Protection Act ("PPA") referred to ERISA plans, as it "undeniably makes an express reference to ERISA and attempts to exclude from coverage of the PPA at least some ERISA plans.
Thus it 'singles out ERISA employee benefit plans for different treatment under state [law], [and therefore] is preempted under [1144(a)].'"
Id. at 824 (quoting Mackey ).
See also CIGNA Healthplan of La., Inc. v. Louisiana , 82 F.3d 642, 647-48 (5th Cir.1996) (concluding that Louisiana's AWP statute, 2202(5)(c) of the State's Health Care Cost Control Act, which applied to "group purchasers," referred to ERISA qualified plans by defining "group purchasers" to include entities such as "'Taft-Hartley trusts or employers who establish or participate in self-funded trusts or programs' which 'contract [with health care providers] for the benefit of their employees.'").
Although in the recent case of Washington Physicians Service Association v. Gregoire , 147 F.3d 1039 (9th Cir.1998), cert. denied , 525 U.S. 1141 , 119 S.Ct. 1033 , 143 L.Ed.2d 42 (1999), the court found that Washington's "every category of provider" statute did not contain a "reference to" or "connection with" employee benefit plans, the statute at issue is distinguishable from Kentucky's AWP laws.
The court noted that by the statute's definition, "health carrier" only included disability insurers, health care service contractors, or health maintenance organizations.
See id. at 1043 .
Employer-sponsored, self-funded plans were excluded not by a provision of the act, but rather by limiting the act's application to only the mentioned entities.
As a result, the act contained no reference whatsoever to ERISA-covered employee benefit plans.
While a mere reference to an ERISA plan, without more, may not be enough to cause preemption, Supreme Court precedent shows that if such a reference is combined with some effect on those plans, such as singling them out for different treatment, preemption will result.
See, e.g. , Mackey , 486 U.S. at 830 n. 4, 108 S.Ct. at 2186 , 100 L.Ed.2d at 844 ; cf. District of Columbia v. Greater Washington Bd. of Trade , 506 U.S. 125 , 113 S.Ct. 580 , 121 L.Ed.2d 513 (1992) (finding that a state law that imposes requirements merely by reference to ERISA is preempted).
We conclude that Kentucky's AWP statutes "relate to" ERISA plans and are therefore preempted, unless they are found to be statutes that regulate "insurance" under the savings clause of 514(b)(2) (A).
This conclusion also involves consideration of the "deemer" clause, 514(b)(2) (B), which ensures that ERISA employee benefit plans are not deemed to be engaged in the business of insurance in applying the savings clause.
Under the deemer clause, state insurance laws that apply directly to ERISA self-insured plans do not fall within the savings clause and thus are preempted.
Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts , 471 U.S. 724 , 105 S.Ct. 2380 , 85 L.Ed.2d 728 (1985); FMC Corp. v. Holliday , 498 U.S. 52 , 111 S.Ct. 403 , 112 L.Ed.2d 356 (1990).
The Kentucky legislature, aware of its inability to regulate self-insured ERISA plans, sought to include such plans--as well as multiple employer welfare arrangements (MEWAs)--only "to the extent permitted by ERISA."
The effect of this provision is to exclude self-insured ERISA plans from coverage of the statute by virtue of the deemer clause and to include MEWAs only to the extent state regulation is permitted under 29 U.S.C. 1144(B)(6) .
7 In Community Health Partners v. Commonwealth of Kentucky , 14 F.Supp.2d 991 (W.D.Ky.1998), District Judge McKinley pointed this out in his opinion: 29 U.S.C. 1144(b)(2)(B) See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts 471 U.S. 724, 732 105 S.Ct. 2380 85 L.Ed.2d 728 Id. at 995 n. 4.
As the Supreme Court noted in UNUM Life Insurance Co. v. Ward , 526 U.S. 358, 367 n. 2, 119 S.Ct. 1380, 1386 , 143 L.Ed.2d 462, 472 (1999): The Kentucky Act provides that shelter by its exclusion of ERISA self-insured plans from its coverage, but its reference to ERISA plans and its exclusion of self-insured ERISA plans from its coverage clearly bring the statute within the "refer to" prong of the "relate to" analysis.
B. Connection With While the fact that the Kentucky statutes "refer to" ERISA employee benefit plans is enough to potentially preempt them on that basis alone, their "connection with" such plans offers an alternative basis for such preemption.
Analysis under the "connection with" prong has changed somewhat after the Supreme Court's opinion in New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Insurance Co. , 514 U.S. 645 , 115 S.Ct. 1671 , 131 L.Ed.2d 695 (1995).
8 The Travelers Court discussed whether ERISA's preemption provision altered the starting presumption that Congress does not intend to supplant state law.
See id. at 654-55 , 115 S.Ct. at 1676-77 , 131 L.Ed.2d at 704 .
While observing that this presumption remained unaltered, the Court recognized that its prior attempts to construe "relate to" did not provide much help drawing the line as to what should be preempted.
See id. at 655 , 115 S.Ct. at 1677 , 131 L.Ed.2d at 705 .
The Court concluded that in order to determine whether the normal presumption against preemption has been overcome in a particular case, it "must go beyond the unhelpful text and the frustrating difficulty of defining [ 514(a) 's] key term, and look instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive."
Id. at 656 , 115 S.Ct. at 1677 , 131 L.Ed.2d at 705 .
The Court found that the "basic thrust" of the clause was "to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans," and observed that under its past case law it had found ERISA to preempt state laws that mandated employee benefit structures or their administration.
Id. at 657-58 , 115 S.Ct. at 1677-78 , 131 L.Ed.2d at 706 .
The use of this approach for "connection with" analysis was subsequently endorsed and used by the Court both in Dillingham and De Buono and recognized by this circuit in Davies v. Centennial Life Insurance Co. , 128 F.3d 934 (6th Cir.1997).
9 Using the Travelers "connection with" analysis, the district court in the case at bar determined that Kentucky's AWP laws had a connection with ERISA plans.
The court found that while the law did not operate directly on ERISA plans, it effectively required benefit plans to purchase benefits of a certain structure, thereby bearing indirectly but substantially on all insured plans.
As a result, the court concluded that the AWP statutes did more than just indirectly affect the cost of ERISA plans; the AWP statutes mandated benefit structures.
Two other district courts in Kentucky recently drew the same conclusion while addressing the same statute.
In Community Health Partners, Inc. v. Kentucky , 14 F.Supp.2d 991, 1000-01 (W.D.Ky.1998), the court found Kentucky's AWP provision, located then at 304.17A-110 (3), to be similar in effect to the mandated benefit law in Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Massachusetts , 471 U.S. 724 , 105 S.Ct. 2380 , 85 L.Ed.2d 728 (1985).
In Metropolitan , the Supreme Court held that the Massachusetts mandated benefit law "related to" ERISA plans because the statute bore indirectly, but substantially, on all insured employee benefit plans by effectively requiring the plans to purchase mental health benefits when purchasing a certain kind of common insurance policy.
See id. at 739 , 105 S.Ct. at 2388 , 85 L.Ed.2d at 740 .
Similarly, the Community Health Partners court believed that the AWP law effectively mandated the benefit structure of ERISA plans and regulated the relationship between traditional ERISA entities, i.e. , the plan, the employer, and the plan fiduciaries and beneficiaries.
14 F.Supp.2d at 997 .
A recent memorandum opinion, Ward v. Alternative Health Delivery Systems, Inc. , 55 F.Supp.2d 694 (W.D.Ky.1999), held that 304.17A-171 , which contains regulations of a health benefit plan's use of chiropractic services, including an AWP provision, was preempted by ERISA due to its connection with employee benefit plans.
Id. at 701 .
The judge found that: Id. at 699 .
Some academic literature has suggested that the Supreme Court's post Travelers case law may represent a "sea change" in the "relation to" analysis; however, neither the Court's nor the circuits' opinions yet confirm this assertion.
10 The two appellate courts that have addressed the issue since Travelers both found that the AWP statutes at issue were "connected with" ERISA covered employee benefit plans.
See CIGNA Healthplan of La., Inc. v. Louisiana , 82 F.3d 642, 648-49 (5th Cir.1996); Texas Pharmacy Ass'n v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. 105 F.3d 1035, 1037 (5th Cir.1997).
In both of these cases, the courts recognized that under the reasoning of Travelers , state laws that mandate employee benefit structures are preempted.
Finding the AWP statutes at issue did exactly that, both courts concluded that they were trumped by ERISA's preemption provision.
Cf. Stuart Circle Hosp. Corp. v. Aetna Health Management , 995 F.2d 500, 502 (4th Cir.1993) (finding, in a case prior to Travelers , that Virginia's AWP statute related to ERISA covered employee benefit plans because it eliminated an insurer's ability to choose limited provider networks).
We are convinced that even after the change of emphasis worked by Travelers on the "connection with" prong of the Supreme Court's "relation to" preemption analysis, the district court in this case was correct in finding that former 304.17A-110 (3) (now 304.17A-270 ) and present 304.17A-171 were both "connected with" ERISA covered plans.
They not only affect the benefits available by increasing the potential providers, they directly affect the administration of the plans.
The Kentucky statutes in question meet both prongs of the "relation to" analysis and thus are preempted, unless found to be statutes that regulate insurance under the savings clause of 514(b)(2) (A).
III.
Insurance Savings Clause Having concluded that Kentucky's AWP laws relate to ERISA covered employee benefit plans, and are thus within the scope of ERISA's preemption provision, the Court must then determine whether the laws fall within ERISA's savings clause.
The savings clause states that, "[e]xcept as provided in subparagraph (B), nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any State which regulates insurance, banking or securities."
ERISA 514(b)(2) (A), 29 U.S.C. 1144(b)(2)(A) .
This provision provides a broad and important exception to ERISA's preemption provision, saving state laws that relate to ERISA plans from preemption so long as they "regulate insurance."
Much like the preemption provision itself, however, the scope of the savings clause has proved difficult to determine from its sparse language.
11 The Supreme Court has endeavored to provide guidance on what it means to "regulate insurance," first addressing the issue in Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Massachusetts , 471 U.S. 724 , 105 S.Ct. 2380 , 85 L.Ed.2d 728 (1985), and most recently describing the test in UNUM Life Insurance of America v. Ward , 526 U.S. 358 , 119 S.Ct. 1380 , 143 L.Ed.2d 462 (1999), stating: Ward , 526 U.S. at 367-68 , 119 S.Ct. at 1386 , 143 L.Ed.2d at 472 .
The Court noted that the three McCarran-Ferguson factors are "'considerations [to be] weighed' in determining whether a state law regulates insurance" and that "[n]one of these criteria is necessarily determinative in itself."
See id. at 373 , 119 S.Ct. at 1389 , 143 L.Ed.2d at 476 .
Therefore, in determining whether Kentucky's AWP laws are saved from preemption by ERISA 514(b)(2) (A), one must first ask whether as a matter of common sense they regulate insurance, and then look to the McCarran-Ferguson factors as checking points or guideposts to aid the analysis.
In Ward , the Court was faced with the question of whether California's notice-prejudice rule 12 was preempted by ERISA.
The parties had agreed that California's notice-prejudice rule "related to" ERISA covered plans under 514(a) , so the Court had only to determine whether the rule was saved by the insurance regulation savings clause of 514(b)(2) (A).
526 U.S. at 367 , 119 S.Ct. at 1386 , 143 L.Ed.2d at 472 .
The Court began with the common sense prong of its insurance regulation savings clause test, observing that: Cisneros [v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America 134 F.3d at 945 Ibid. ; Pilot Life 481 U.S. at 50 107 S.Ct. 1549 95 L.Ed.2d 39 Ward , 526 U.S. at 368 , 119 S.Ct. at 1386-87 , 143 L.Ed.2d at 472-73 .
Ward makes it clear that the most important aspect of the test is whether from a common sense view of the matter the contested statute regulates insurance.
The three McCarran-Ferguson factors are of secondary importance, serving only as "checking points" or "guideposts" and not as essential elements.
Indeed, in Ward , the Court ignored the first McCarran-Ferguson factor altogether in its analysis of the challenged statute in that case. The Kentucky Act meets the common sense test in that it clearly does regulate insurance.
The fact that it includes within its reach HMOs as well as traditional insurance companies does not take it out of the realm of insurance regulation.
We agree with the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit in Washington Physicians Service Association v. Gregoire , 147 F.3d 1039 (9th Cir.1998), in which the Court said: Pilot Life 481 U.S. at 50 107 S.Ct. 1549 Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co. 440 U.S. 205, 211 99 S.Ct. 1067 59 L.Ed.2d 261 1:3 Anderson v. Humana, Inc. 24 F.3d 889, 890 Metropolitan Life 471 U.S. at 741 105 S.Ct. 2380 Klamath-Lake Pharmaceutical Ass'n v. Klamath Med. Serv. Bureau 701 F.2d 1276, 1286-87 Id. at 1045-46 .
13 In Anderson v. Humana, Inc. , 24 F.3d 889, 892 (7th Cir.1994), the court said: "Because HMOs spread risk--both across patients and over time for any given person--they are insurance vehicles under Illinois law."
They are likewise "insurance vehicles" under Kentucky law.
It is true that the statutes would reach certain self-insured health care benefit plans that are not under ERISA's protective "deemer" clause, e.g. , self-insured government plans and self-insured church plans, because they are excluded entirely from ERISA's coverage under 29 U.S.C. 1003(b) .
We do not see this fact, however, as any barrier to a finding that a common sense view is that the statutes regulate insurance.
We know of no reason why it is not within the authority of a state in enacting laws dealing with insurance to include within such laws entities that act as self-insurers as well as entities who purchase insurance.
As the author of a well-known treatise has said, "Self-insurance has often led courts and legislatures to struggle with the intriguing question of whether a party who has not purchased insurance, effectively acting as its own insurer, should be the equivalent of an insurer."

It is pointed out that this difficulty in modern practice is frequently removed by express statutory provisions specifying that a particular requirement does or does not apply to self-insured entities.
Id .
Kentucky has done this by expressly including self-insurers--to the extent permitted by ERISA--within the coverage of the statutes in question.
The state's regulation of health benefit plans is set forth in Kentucky's Insurance Code (Chapter 304 of Title XXV dealing with Business and Financial Institutions).
Subtitle 17A of the Insurance Code deals with health insurers and health benefit plans.
Section 304.17A-005 contains the definition of words used in that subtitle.
Paragraph 22 provides: "Health benefit plan" is also defined, the relevant portion of that definition tracking the above definition of "insurer:" Ky.Rev.Stat.
Ann. 304.17A-005(17) .
The AWP provision of Kentucky's Insurance Code specifically is directed at "insurers" by providing that: health insurer Ky.Rev.Stat.
Ann. 304.17A-270 .
The chiropractic AWP provision specifically adopts the definition of a health benefit plan as set forth in Kentucky Revised Statutes Annotated 304.17A-005 and defines "health care insurer" as any entity "authorized by the state of Kentucky to offer or provide health benefit plans, policies, subscriber contracts, or any other contracts of similar nature which indemnify or compensate health care providers for the provision of health care services."
Ky.Rev.Stat.
Ann. 304.17A-170(7) .
The Kentucky AWP laws are thus specifically directed toward "insurers" and the insurance industry and are ones that from a "common sense view" regulate insurance.
The fact that the deemer clause prevents ERISA self-insured plans from being considered as engaging in the business of insurance does not mean that self-insured plans, by their nature, do not involve the business of insurance and are beyond the reach of state regulations dealing with insurance.
The distinction between plans funded by the purchase of insurance and plans that are funded by employers as self-insured plans results from "a distinction created by Congress in the 'deemer clause,' a distinction Congress is aware of and one it has chosen not to alter."
Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts , 471 U.S. at 747 , 105 S.Ct. at 2393 , 85 L.Ed.2d at 745 .
It is not a distinction based upon a concept that employers who choose to be self-insurers cannot be considered insurers subject to state regulations dealing with insurance.
Therefore, the fact that the Kentucky statute reaches self-insurers who are not protected by ERISA's deemer clause does not detract from its characterization as a statute regulating entities engaged in the business of health insurance.
As noted earlier, the Kentucky statutes exclude from their scope self-insured ERISA plans.
If such a plan provides for a limited group of providers, the AWP laws would not compel a change in that plan, regardless of the nature of the entity administering the plan.
It could not be enforced, in our opinion, against the employer who has a self-insured ERISA plan nor against the administrator of such a plan, even if the administrator is an entity, such as an HMO, which would be subject to the statute if it were acting not as a mere administrator but as an insurer of its own plan.
In Light v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield , 790 F.2d 1247 (5th Cir.1986), the court rejected the argument that a state law could be enforced against the administrator of a self-insured ERISA plan because the deemer clause, 514(b)(2) (B), which protects such plans from state regulation, does not expressly include plan administrators among the exempted entities.
The court found the fact that administrators of self-insured plans are not mentioned in the deemer clause to be of no significance, and because the state law was preempted, the claim against the administrator of the plan based on that law could not be brought, even though the plan itself provided that the contracts between the employer and the plan administrator would "conform to applicable state laws."
The court observed that, "If ERISA preempts state law, there is no applicable state law to which the administrator must conform."
Id. at 1248 .
In Prudential Insurance Company of America v. National Park Medical Center, Inc. , 154 F.3d 812 (8th Cir.1998), the court found that an Arkansas statute that contained an AWP provision did not meet the common sense test because, in part, its scope included "employers and administrators of self-insured plans" (although the statute excluded ERISA self-funded plans).
As noted above, however, we do not believe that inclusion of self-insurers not protected by the deemer clause, as well as purchasers of insurance, within the statute's reach in itself removes the statute from being viewed a permissible regulation of insurance based upon "a common understanding of insurance regulation."
Also, unlike the Arkansas statute, the Kentucky statutes do not include "administrators of self-insured plans."
They are directed towards and limited to health care "insurers."
14 Texas Pharmacy Association v. Prudential Insurance Company of America , 105 F.3d 1035 (5th Cir.1997), contains the statement that if a self-insured employer, not subject to the any willing provider statute, "signed up with an HMO or PPO, those organizations would be subject to the statute, even if there is no insurance company involved."
Id. at 1039 .
The court was presumably referring to the HMO or PPO acting as the administrator of the employer's self-funded plan.
We believe, however, that, as the court in Light observed, if ERISA preempts the state law with respect to self-funded plans, there is no state law to which the administrator of the self-funded plan must conform.
Furthermore, as previously noted, the Kentucky statute is directed toward and applies to only insurers and not to plan administrators.
Supra , note 14.
A plan administrator that does nothing more than administer the plan of a self-insured employer is not engaged in "the underwriting and spreading of risk," Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co. , 440 U.S. 205, 221 , 99 S.Ct. 1067, 1077 , 59 L.Ed.2d 261, 274 (1979), and in our view, would not be considered an "insurer" of a health benefit plan as that term is used in Kentucky's AWP laws.
15 In Metropolitan Life , 471 U.S. at 743-44 , 105 S.Ct. at 2391 , 85 L.Ed.2d at 743 , the Supreme Court said: SEC v. National Securities, Inc. 393 U.S. 453, 460 89 S.Ct. 564, 568 21 L.Ed.2d 668 The Kentucky AWP laws deal directly with the relationship between insurers and insureds under health benefit plans.
They affect restrictions by the insurers on the number of health care providers available to the insureds under such plans; they increase benefits to the insureds by giving them greater freedom to choose health care providers under the plans; and they are aimed at regulating this insurance relationship.
They are part of a comprehensive subtitle of Kentucky's insurance code regulating health benefit plans, and they are, in our view, clearly laws which, in a common sense view of the matter, "regulate insurance" and thus are saved from preemption.
Consideration of the three McCarran-Ferguson factors used in the second step of the analysis as "checking points" or "guideposts" does not require a different result.
First, although certainly a debatable issue, we agree with the reasoning of the Fourth Circuit in Stuart Circle Hospital Corp. v. Aetna Health Management , 995 F.2d 500 (4th Cir.1993), that the first factor--"transferring or spreading the policyholder's risk"--is satisfied: Id. at 503 .
Plaintiffs point out that the Kentucky statutes in question do not require health benefit plans to contract with any additional provider, but only with providers who are willing to meet the network's terms and conditions.
While this is unquestionably true, it does not, in our view, change the fact that the statutes open an otherwise closed door, insofar as the availability of health care providers is concerned.
Some may choose to go through that door and join the group of providers while others may not, but this does not mean that removal of a restriction on availability of providers is not a benefit conferred on the insureds.
It effectively changes the terms of the policy, admittedly not in terms of covered medical conditions, but in terms of covered treatment by health care providers.
16 While Plaintiffs understandably rely on Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co. , 440 U.S. 205 , 99 S.Ct. 1067 , 59 L.Ed.2d 261 (1979), in support of their position that the first factor is not present in this case, we believe Royal Drug does not require that conclusion.
Unlike the health plans that are the subject of the Kentucky statutes, the insurer in Royal Drug did not restrict the number of providers in question.
Blue Cross had offered to enter into a provider agreement with every licensed pharmacy in Texas.
The benefit conferred on the insureds by the Kentucky AWP statutes--removal of restrictions on the number of providers--was already present in Royal Drug .
The Supreme Court expressly noted, with reference to its discussion of contracts between the insurer and providers, "[t]his is not to say that the contracts offered by Blue Shield to its policyholders, as distinguished from its provider agreements with participating pharmacies, may not be the 'business of insurance' within the meaning of the [McCarran-Ferguson] Act."
Id. at 230 n. 37, 99 S.Ct. at 1082 , 59 L.Ed.2d at 279 .
Unlike Royal Drug , policyholders in Kentucky will benefit under their policies by a new change in coverage, insofar as availability of providers is concerned.
17 The policyholders in Royal Drug were "basically unconcerned with arrangements made between Blue Shield and participating pharmacies."
Id. at 214 , 99 S.Ct. at 1074 , 59 L.Ed.2d at 270 .
They paid a fixed price ($2.00) to a participating pharmacy for each prescription, and consequently they were not concerned with Blue Shield's cost for those prescriptions.
Similarly, the policyholders in Kentucky are basically unconcerned with arrangements made between the insurers and participating providers regarding the insurers' cost for the medical services obtained by the insurers.
The Kentucky statutes do not seek to change the terms and conditions of those cost arrangements.
They merely require that any provider who is willing to meet the same terms and conditions of those arrangements should be allowed to join the list of participating providers.
While Kentucky policyholders may be basically unconcerned with the insurers' compensation arrangements with participating providers, it cannot be said that they are unconcerned with a limitation on the number of such providers and the resulting restriction on their freedom of choice in seeking medical treatment.
18 The Fifth Circuit has also distinguished Royal Drug in its discussion of a prior Texas AWP statute pertaining to pharmacies in Texas Pharmacy Association v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America , 105 F.3d 1035 (5th Cir.1997), agreeing with the reasoning of the Fourth Circuit in Stuart Circle Hospital Corp. "Unlike the third-party pharmacy agreements in Royal Drug , the prior Texas statute directly regulated the terms of the insurance policy between the insurer and the insured."
Id. at 1041 .
Finally, it should be emphasized, in applying the McCarran-Ferguson factors, that "the focus of McCarran-Ferguson is upon the relationship between the insurance company and its policyholders," and state statutes aimed at regulating that relationship, "directly or indirectly, are laws regulating the 'business of insurance.'"
United States Dep't of the Treasury v. Fabe , 508 U.S. 491, 501 , 113 S.Ct. 2202, 2208 , 124 L.Ed.2d 449, 459 (1993).
In Fabe , the Court held that, "[t]here can be no doubt that the actual performance of an insurance contract falls within the 'business of insurance,' as we understood that phrase in Pireno and Royal Drug ."
Id. at 503 , 113 S.Ct. at 2209 , 124 L.Ed.2d at 461 .
Furthermore, in Fabe , the Court distinguished Royal Drug on the ground that it was an antitrust law case, and the Court in that case was construing the words, "the business of insurance" contained in the second clause of 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the antitrust law exemption ( see 15 U.S.C. 1012(b) ).
19 The first clause, which commits laws "enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance" to the States is, according to the Supreme Court, "not so narrowly circumscribed."
Id. at 504 , 113 S.Ct. at 2209 , 124 L.Ed.2d at 461 .
The second McCarran-Ferguson factor is, in our view, unquestionably present in this case. The ability of an insured to select a physician of his or her choice to treat a medical condition covered by the insurance is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured.
In Ward , the Supreme Court dealt with a state law which required an insurer to show that it was prejudiced by an untimely proof of claim before it could avoid liability.
The Court, as noted earlier, did not even pursue the issue of whether the statute satisfied the first factor--the risk alteration factor--because the other two factors verified the common sense view of the statute as one regulating insurance.
The Court specifically rejected the argument that the statute was not such a law because it did not change any substantive terms of the insurance coverage.
See Metropolitan Life 471 U.S. at 728 105 S.Ct. 2380 85 L.Ed.2d 728 526 U.S. at 375 n. 5, 119 S.Ct. at 1390 , 143 L.Ed.2d at 477 .
In Plaintiffs' view, the second factor is not satisfied because the AWP provisions leave the contract terms between the insurer and the insured unaltered, the medical risks remain the same, and even if an insured's provider decides to join the insured's network, the medical coverage remains the same.
While it is admittedly true that the AWP laws do not change the substantive terms of the insurance coverage, it is not necessary that the statutes do this before they can be found to be statutes regulating insurance.
Id. Kentucky's AWP laws do, however, directly impact the insurer-insured relationship because they affect restrictions on the network of providers available for treatment under the plan and they directly affect the administration of the plan.
As in Ward , the statutes effectively create a mandatory contract term dealing with the manner in which the plan is administered by expanding covered treatment from a closed pool of providers to an open pool of providers.
As the Fourth Circuit said in Stuart Circle Hospital Corp. , 995 F.2d at 503 , "We repeat, treatment and cost are important components of health insurance.
Regulations governing these components, such as the Virginia statute, are integral parts of the relationship between insurer and insured."
In our view, the second McCarran-Ferguson factor is clearly satisfied.
We also conclude that the third factor--the statute's limitations to entities within the insurance industry--is satisfied.
For reasons stated earlier, we believe that entities such as HMOs and self-insurers are engaged in the business of insurance along with the more widely recognized and more traditional commercial insurance companies, and that entities acting solely as plan administrators and not as "health insurers" are not within the scope of the statute.
As District Judge McKinley pointed out in Community Health Partners : Cf. SEC v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co. 359 U.S. 65, 71 79 S.Ct. 618 3 L.Ed.2d 640 14 F.Supp.2d at 1003-04 .
20 It must be reiterated and emphasized that the three McCarran-Ferguson factors are not required to be satisfied before a state law can be found to be a law regulating insurance.
They are, as the Supreme Court pointed out in Ward , nothing more than "checking points" or "guideposts."
The basic test is whether, from a common sense view, the Kentucky AWP laws in question regulate insurance.
We conclude, as did the two Kentucky District Judges who carefully considered this question, that they do.
IV.
Conclusion With respect to Kentucky's AWP statute, Kentucky Revised Statutes Annotated 304.17A-270 (Banks-Baldwin 1999), and Kentucky's chiropractic AWP statute, Kentucky Revised Statutes Annotated 304.17A-171 (2) (Banks-Baldwin 1999), the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
Because the district court opinion does not discuss the additional requirements imposed by provisions (1) and (3)-(8) of 304.17A-171 , dealing with chiropractors and health benefit plans, this case is remanded to the district court for consideration in the first instance of the issue of their preemption by ERISA.
