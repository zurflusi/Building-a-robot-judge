 ORDER The Order and Opinion filed on February 24, 1999, is amended as follows: Replace the last paragraph on page 12, continuing on to page 13, with the following: A further word concerning the death warrant is in order.
The warrant parallels the statute in giving LaGrand a choice of the method of execution.
A.R.S.
13.704B provides: The petitioner did choose execution by lethal gas twenty days prior to the execution date.
The State acknowledged at oral argument that the petitioner could not change his mind.
Thus, execution under the existing warrant would require execution by lethal gas.
Since we have held the method chosen by LaGrand to be unconstitutional, the death warrant must be reissued in a form that does not require execution by lethal gas.
