 FRANK , Circuit Judge.
The facts are fully stated in Judge Weinfeld's excellent opinion, 128 F.Supp.
617 , the reasoning and conclusions of which we adopt.
It is well to add a few words about defendant's contention concerning the doctrine of Brown v. Walker , 161 U.S. 591 , 16 S.Ct. 644 , 40 L.Ed. 819 , which held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination relates solely to testimony that might lead to defendant's prosecution for a crime.
Defendant asks us to modify this doctrine in the light of new circumstances which have since arisen.
1 We are not prepared to say that this suggestion lacks all merit.
2 But our possible views on the subject have no significance.
For an inferior court like ours may not modify a Supreme Court doctrine in the absence of any indication of new doctrinal trends in that Court's opinions, 3 and we perceive none that are pertinent here.
Accordingly, the argument must be addressed not to our ears but to eighteen others in Washington, D. C. Affirmed.
