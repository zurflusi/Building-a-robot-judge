 J. SKELLY WRIGHT , Circuit Judge: In the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.
(1976 & Supp. V 1981), Congress has required the Secretary of Health and Human Services or her delegate, the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 1 to assure that all "new drugs" are "safe and effective" for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested on the official labeling.
2 Id .
355(a) .
Before the Commissioner can allow a "new drug" to be distributed in interstate commerce, FDA must assure the safety of the drug and the adequacy of its branding.
Id .
331 , 355 ; see also 21 C.F.R. 201 et seq.
(1983).
A drug is "misbranded," and impermissibly available for use by consumers, unless its labeling bears adequate directions for use and such adequate warnings against unapproved uses or methods of administration as are necessary for the protection of its users.
21 U.S.C. 352(f) .
The Commissioner has previously interpreted FDCA's labeling requirements to impose upon FDA the "obligat[ion]" to investigate and take appropriate action against unapproved uses of approved drugs where such unapproved use becomes widespread or endangers the public health.
See Legal Status of Approved Labeling for Prescription Drugs; Prescribing for Uses Unapproved by the Food and Drug Administration , 37 Fed.Reg.
16503 , 16504 (August 15, 1972) (hereinafter Policy Statement ).
3 In this case we review FDA's decision to take no action--either investigatory or regulatory- [**139] against the unapproved use of approved drugs in state capital punishment systems.
Appellants, eight prison inmates under sentence of death in Texas and Oklahoma, 4 claim that FDA has arbitrarily and capriciously refused to prevent the use of drugs not proven "safe and effective" as a means of human execution.
5 Their petition to FDA asserted that use of barbiturates and paralytics as capital punishment devices, without prior FDA approval, violates the "new drug" and "misbranding" provisions of FDCA, see 21 U.S.C. 352 , 355.
6 FDA, in response, asserted that its jurisdiction did not extend to the regulation of state-sanctioned use of lethal injections and that, even if it did, FDA would, as a matter of its inherent enforcement discretion, undertake no investigatory or regulatory activity.
Letter dated July 7, 1981 from the Commissioner to appellants' counsel (hereinafter Letter from the Commissioner), Joint Appendix (JA) 86-89.
The District Court granted summary judgment against appellants' challenge to FDA's inaction.
See Memorandum Opinion filed August 30, 1982 in D .D.C.
Civil Action No. 81-2265 (hereinafter Dist.Ct.Op.
), JA 215-231.
Because we believe that FDA arbitrarily and capriciously refused to exercise its regulatory jurisdiction, we vacate the District Court's judgment and remand the case to it for further action consistent with this opinion.
I. Background During the last six years at least five states, including Texas and Oklahoma, have enacted statutes adopting lethal injection as a means of human execution.
7 Prisons in these five states house over 200 of the approximately 1,100 persons sentenced to death in the United States, and at least six other states (with 300 persons on death row) apparently are considering adopting lethal injection as a means of capital punishment.
8 On December 7, 1982 Texas became the first state to actually administer a lethal injection to a condemned inmate.
9 Because the lethal injection statutes authorize state prison officials to make unapproved use of drugs distributed in interstate commerce, appellants petitioned FDA to enforce the Act against the states.
10 Their December 19, 1980 petition recited the known evidence concerning lethal injection, which strongly indicates that such drugs pose a substantial threat of torturous pain to persons being executed.
R OYAL C OMMISSION ON C APITAL P UNISHMENT , 1949-1953 R EPORT (1953), Exhibit 1 to Letter dated December 19, 1980 from counsel for appellants to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (hereinafter Letter to the Secretary), JA 34-40.
Appellants appended to their petition affidavits of leading medical and scientific experts which aver that there is no "expert consensus" founded upon "substantial evidence" that these drugs will produce death quickly and without pain and [**140] discomfort.
Exhibit 2 to Letter to the Secretary, JA 43-83.
Indeed, these affiants were not aware of any published data or investigations that would establish the effectiveness of such drugs for lethal injection.
Id .
With this evidence as grounds, appellants requested that FDA take the following actions: Letter to the Secretary at 18-19, JA 31-32.
In addition, appellants requested an evidentiary hearing on any issue of controlling fact.
Id. at 19 , JA 32.
11 On July 7, 1981 the Commissioner of FDA, by letter, refused to take any of the actions requested in appellants' petition.
Letter from the Commissioner at 2, JA 87.
Rather than investigate appellants' claims, the Commissioner asserted that FDA's jurisdiction did not extend to the regulation of state-sanctioned use of lethal injections.
Id .
Indeed, because these were "duly authorized statutory enactments [that furthered] proper State functions," the Commissioner indicated that, even if it had jurisdiction, FDA would not gather any evidence or pursue any enforcement.
Id. at 3 , JA 88.
He noted two reasons for refusing to investigate or to enforce: (1) the case law on the unapproved use of drugs otherwise approved by FDA was not uniform, and (2) FDA had a policy of not initiating enforcement action against unapproved uses of approved drugs absent "serious danger to the public health."
Id .
The Commissioner could find no such "danger" where a state had properly enacted a capital punishment law.
Id .
On September 16, 1981 appellants filed suit in the District Court seeking to compel FDA to fulfill its statutory obligation to investigate and to regulate the unapproved use of approved drugs in human execution systems.
After limited discovery, both appellants and FDA filed cross-motions for summary judgment.
On August 30, 1982 the District Court granted summary judgment to FDA.
The court declined to decide the jurisdictional issue, but went on to hold that "decisions of executive departments and agencies to refrain from instituting investigations and enforcement proceedings are essentially unreviewable by the courts."
Dist.Ct.Op.
at 10, JA 224 (emphasis in original).
Thus FDA's "decision to refrain from interfering with the implementation of state capital punishment statutes constitutes a defensible [**141] exercise of [its] considerable investigative and enforcement discretion *."
Id. at 2 , JA 216.
The District Court noted that the Commissioner had explained FDA's reasons for not acting, id. at 13 , JA 227, and, though the court could not review these reasons for their rationality, 12 it therefore found that FDA had not completely abdicated its statutory responsibilities, id. at 15 , JA 229.
Larry Leon Chaney and the other seven prisoners then filed this appeal.
II.
FDA's Jurisdiction Over Lethal Injections The Commissioner of FDA refused to investigate appellants' allegations or to assess and respond to the evidence they presented.
Instead, he asserted that FDA did not have jurisdiction to interfere with state governments' use of prescription drugs for the purpose of causing death by injection.
We disagree.
In determining whether FDA has jurisdiction over a particular drug or practice, the Supreme Court has counselled us to inquire "not merely into statutory purpose," but also into the "various sorts of supervision [needed] to effectuate the goals of the Act *."
Toilet Goods Ass'n, Inc. v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 158, 163-164 , 87 S.Ct. 1520, 1524-1525 , 18 L.Ed.2d 697 (1967).
Jurisdiction is to be analyzed in terms of "consumer protection, not dialectics."
United States v. Urbuteit , 335 U.S. 355, 357-358 , 69 S.Ct. 112, 113-114 , 93 L.Ed. 61 (1948).
Congress clearly intended that the Act's "coverage be as broad as its literal language indicates *."
United States v. Bacto-Unidisk , 394 U.S. 784, 798 , 89 S.Ct. 1410, 1418 , 22 L.Ed.2d 726 (1969).
Thus the Act has been held to apply to situations where drugs are held by retailers, United States v. Sullivan , 332 U.S. 689, 696-697 , 68 S.Ct. 331, 335-336 , 92 L.Ed. 297 (1948), wholesalers, DeFreese v. United States , 270 F.2d 730 (5th Cir.1959), cert. denied , 362 U.S. 944 , 80 S.Ct. 810 , 4 L.Ed.2d 772 (1960), bailees, United States v. Wiesenfeld Warehouse Co. , 376 U.S. 86, 92 , 84 S.Ct. 559, 563 , 11 L.Ed.2d 536 (1964), and physicians, United States v. Evers , 643 F.2d 1043 (5th Cir.1981).
As explained by the court in United States v. 10 Cartons, Labeled in Part "Hoxsey" , 152 F.Supp.
360, 365 (W.D.Pa.1957), it "is not the holding for sale in a technical legal sense which gives rise to the federal jurisdiction but the fact that the channels of commerce have been used."
See also United States v. Sene X Eleemosynary Corp. , 479 F.Supp 970, 981 (S.D.Fla.1979) ("[t]he 'held for sale' standard of section 301 has long been afforded a liberal reading").
On appeal, FDA does not focus its energies on the argument that the unapproved use of drugs for lethal injection is outside the general jurisdictional provisions of the Act.
Instead, FDA argues that state-sanctioned use of lethal injections comes within a commonly recognized exception to the Act's broad and protective coverage: the "practice-of-medicine" exemption.
FDCA's legislative history expresses a specific intent to prohibit FDA from regulating physicians' practice of medicine.
13 According to the Commissioner, FDCA does not regulate physicians in their practice because physicians are licensed by the states.
Letter from the Commissioner at 3, JA 88.
Since state prisons are also licensed by the states, the Commissioner thought that FDA did not have jurisdiction to regulate the use [**142] of drugs in capital punishment systems.
Id. at 2-3 , JA 87-88.
The problem with the Commissioner's analogy is his starting point: that the practice of medicine is exempt because physicians are licensed by the states.
There is scant legislative history on the subject, 14 but the few sentences that can be found are more fairly read as reflecting Congress' recognition that the states do regulate the practice of medicine and that a physician cannot be eligible for the practice-of-medicine exemption if he has not been so licensed.
The practice-of-medicine exemption itself, however, cannot be attributed to the states' licensing of their physicians.
The better explanation for the practice-of-medicine exemption is that Congress did not want to interfere with physicians' treatment of their patients.
New uses for drugs are often discovered after FDA approves the package inserts that explain a drug's approved uses.
Congress would have created havoc in the practice of medicine had it required physicians to follow the expensive and time-consuming procedure of obtaining FDA approval before putting drugs to new uses.
15 Thus Congress exempted the practice of medicine from the Act so as not to limit a physician's ability to treat his patients.
16 If FDA were correct that physicians' use of drugs is not within FDA's jurisdiction simply because physicians are licensed by the states, then it would necessarily follow that FDA could have no authority to regulate drugs that state-licensed physicians administer to prison inmates in experimental clinical investigations and no authority to regulate drugs that state-licensed veterinarians use to put animals to their death.
But FDA has in fact regulated drugs used in prison clinical investigations, see 21 C.F.R. 50.44 (1983), and in veterinary practices, see United States v. Beauthanasia-D.
Regular , [1979 Transfer Binder] Food Drug Cosm.L.Rep.
(CCH) ¶ 38265 (D.Neb.1979).
In both situations FDA has rejected arguments that it does not have authority to regulate unapproved uses of approved drugs.
17 Nonmedical use of lethal injections therefore cannot fall within the "practice-of-medicine" exemption simply [**143] because the states license their prison facilities.
18 FDA did suggest cursorily in both its brief on appeal, brief for appellee at 26 n. 25, and its initial Letter from the Commissioner, JA 86-88, that the use of drugs for lethal injections, even if not covered by the practice-of-medicine exception, falls outside the jurisdictional ambit of the FDCA.
The dissent to this opinion has graciously elaborated FDA's alternative argument; while acknowledging the inapplicability of the practice-of-medicine exception, the dissent argues that "FDA jurisdiction depends upon the existence of misbranding under 331(k) , which cannot be established under the facts of this case." Dissent at 1198.
Section 331(k) prohibits any action taken upon a "food, drug, device, or cosmetic, if such act is done while such article is held for sale (whether or not the first sale) after shipment in interstate commerce and results in such article being adulterated or misbranded."
21 U.S.C. 331(k) .
The dissent contends that no misbranding could have occurred in the present case because the drugs that prisons hold for use in lethal injections cannot be deemed to be "held for sale" under any "conceivable interpretation of the English language."
Dissent at 1199.
This rhetorical flourish masks what is in essence a "plain meaning" argument, and we do not fulfill our interpretive role when we look only to the statutory language.
Inquiry into the statutory scheme and legislative history of the FDCA and subsequent amendments reveals a specific congressional intent to prevent misbranding of drugs at each stage of the distribution process from manufacturer to patient.
Accord United States v. Evers , 643 F.2d 1043, 1049 (5th Cir.1981).
In the first place, Section 331(b) of the FDCA, which prohibits any misbranding in "interstate commerce," should be sufficiently broad to cover the actions of the state prisons in this case, given the modern constitutional understanding of the breadth of congressional power under the commerce clause.
Moreover, Congress enacted the "held for sale" provision of Section 331(k) , on which the dissent relies, to expand, not to limit, the ambit of the FDCA.
Prior to addition of this language in 1938, the FDCA had been open to an interpretation, under the more restrictive reading of the phrase "interstate commerce" then prevailing, that excluded from the Act's coverage the penultimate actor in the distribution chain if that entity had neither received nor transmitted a misbranded drug in interstate commerce.
Filling this potential gap in the statute's protective scheme, Congress enacted Section 331(k) with the specific and explicitly stated intent to "extend the protection of consumers contemplated by the law to the full extent constitutionally permissible."
H.R.
Rep.
No. 2139, 75th Cong., 3d Sess.
3 (1938).
The drugs that states use have moved through the channels of interstate commerce, see Memorandum in Support of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss at 15, JA 141, and Congress thus is well within its constitutional powers when it seeks to regulate the use to which these drugs are put.
In light of Congress' express intent to exercise these powers to the hilt in Section 331(k) , it would be both ironic and impermissible for [**144] this court to construe that section so as to limit FDA's jurisdiction in this case. 19 In apparent recognition of the broad scope of the term "held for sale," the dissent must strain to argue that Section 331(k) nonetheless does not apply because the prison officials in this case are not the penultimate actors at whom this section is aimed, but rather the ultimate consumers of the drug and thus beyond the strictures of the Act.
This view blinks reality.
The ultimate consumer is not the last person to purchase the drug, but the last person to consume the drug--usually a patient, as United States v. Evers notes, 643 F.2d at 1049 , but in this case the prisoner who receives the lethal injection.
That the prisoner might be an unwilling consumer does not change the fact that the prisoner is the one who will suffer an excruciating death if this unapproved administration is conducted improperly.
Styling the ultimate purchaser as the ultimate consumer, the dissent would free from the strictures of the FDCA any use to which the purchaser wished to put the drugs.
Such a reading thwarts the ultimate purpose of Section 331 of the FDCA--protection of those who consume drugs from the potential harm of misbranding by anyone in the chain of distribution.
20 FDA admits that it has jurisdiction over all state laws "that purport[ ] to legitimize the lawful shipment of an unapproved drug in interstate commerce, or that purport[ ] to permit its misbranding after shipment *."
Brief for appellee at 20 n. 21.
The states' lethal injection statutes purport to mandate the use of certain prescription drugs for a purpose not listed on their label.
The activity of the states falls within the jurisdictional ambit of Section 331 of the FDCA, and the practice-of-medicine exception does not immunize this activity from the FDCA's prohibition of misbranding.
FDA therefore must have jurisdiction to regulate such activity.
21 III.
Enforcement Discretion Of course, FDA determined that even if it had jurisdiction it would choose, in its [**145] inherent enforcement discretion, not to investigate or to take any regulatory action.
Letter from the Commissioner at 3, JA 88.
The District Court held both that FDA's decision to refrain from investigation and enforcement was unreviewable and that, in any event, the decision did not amount to a complete abdication of statutory responsibility.
Dist.Ct.Op.
at 10-15, JA 224-229.
We find that the District Court misunderstood and misapplied its review authority.
A. Judicial Review of Enforcement Discretion Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 701(a) (1982), governs judicial review of agency action.
Under Section 10 , all final agency action is subject to judicial review unless such review is precluded by statute or committed to agency discretion by law. 5 U.S.C. 701(a)(1) & (2).
22 This section establishes a "strong presumption" of reviewability, and the exceptions of 5 U.S.C. 701(a)(1) & (2) should therefore be construed narrowly.
See Dunlop v. Bachowski , 421 U.S. 560, 567 & n. 7, 95 S.Ct. 1851, 1858 & n. 7, 44 L.Ed.2d 377 (1975); Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe , 401 U.S. 402, 410 , 91 S.Ct. 814, 820 , 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971); Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 140-141 , 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1510-1512 , 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967); WWHT, Inc. v. FCC , 656 F.2d 807, 809, 815 (D.C.Cir.1981); Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. SEC , 606 F.2d 1031, 1043 (D.C.Cir.1979).
23 [**146] Neither FDA nor the District Court claims that FDCA precludes judicial review.
24 Rather, both assert that FDCA gives FDA absolute discretion over decisions concerning investigation and enforcement, Letter from the Commissioner at 3, JA 88; Dist.Ct.Op.
at 10, JA 224, and thus commits those decisions to agency discretion by law. 5 U.S.C. 701(a)(2) .
Though some courts have traditionally displayed reluctance to review exercises of enforcement discretion, the Supreme Court has consistently instructed us to construe narrowly the "committed to agency discretion" exception, and to find it applicable only in those rare instances where the governing statute is "drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply."
Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe , supra , 401 U.S. at 410 , 91 S.Ct. at 821 , quoting S.Rep.
No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess.
26 (1945).
25 This admonishment applies with no less force to review of agency enforcement discretion, including agency decisions to refrain from enforcement action.
Dunlop v. Bachowski , supra , 421 U.S. 560 , 95 S.Ct. 1851 , 44 L.Ed.2d 377 [**147] .
The Dunlop case deserves close scrutiny because it held, on facts precisely analogous to those of the present case, that an agency decision not to exercise enforcement discretion was reviewable.
In Dunlop an unsuccessful candidate for a union office complained to the Secretary of Labor that the election was fraudulent, and thus invoked 29 U.S.C. 482 , a provision of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act that empowers the Secretary to investigate such complaints and to bring a civil action to set aside the election if warranted.
421 U.S. at 562-563 , 95 S.Ct. at 1855-1856 .
The Secretary took no action in response to the complaint in Dunlop , and the unsuccessful union candidate sought review of that decision to refrain from exercising enforcement power.
The Secretary argued that his action was unreviewable under Section 10 of the APA, and relied on both the precluded-by-statute and the committed-to-agency-discretion exceptions of Section 10 of the APA.
5 U.S.C. 701(a)(1) & (2) .
Finding neither exception applicable, 421 U.S. at 567 & n. 7, 95 S.Ct. at 1858 & n. 7, the Court held that this discretionary decision to refrain from exercising enforcement power was reviewable.
26 In the present controversy appellants seek nothing more than what the disappointed union official sought in Dunlop : judicial review of an agency decision not to exercise enforcement power.
Dunlop thus precludes a facile resolution denying review in this case because an exercise of enforcement discretion is at issue.
We must, under the test of Overton Park , decide whether there is "law to apply" to FDA's nonenforcement decision in this case. The determination of whether there "is law to apply" turns on such pragmatic considerations as whether judicial supervision is necessary to safeguard plaintiffs' interests, whether judicial review will unnecessarily impede the agency in effectively carrying out its congressionally assigned role, and whether the issues are appropriate for judicial review.
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. SEC , supra , 606 F.2d at 1043-1044 .
We conduct this inquiry to determine whether the considerations favoring nonreviewability are sufficiently compelling to rebut the strong presumption [**148] of judicial review.
Id. In this case, however, we need not delve into a detailed analysis of nonreviewability because the agency has already conducted the inquiry for us.
FDA, in an earlier policy statement, made law to govern and guide its discretion in regulating the unapproved use of approved drugs: Policy Statement , 37 Fed.Reg.
at 16504 .
This policy statement which FDA still considers binding and to have substantive effect, see Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss at 4-5 & nn.
10, 12, JA 131-132, comes within the APA's definition of a rule 27 as that term has been consistently interpreted in this circuit.
The term "rule" is "broad enough 'to include nearly every statement an agency may make *.'"
Center for Auto Safety v. NHTSA , 710 F.2d 842, 846 (D.C.Cir.1983), quoting Batterton v. Marshall , 648 F.2d 694, 700 (D.C.Cir.1980).
In Center for Auto Safety the court concluded that agency policy statements accompanying the withdrawal of a notice of proposed rulemaking fell within the definition of "rule" because they "clearly interpret the relevant statute and indicate NHTSA's policy regarding the exercise of discretion granted to it by that legislative enactment."
710 F.2d at 846 .
The FDA policy statement quoted above also interprets the relevant statute and indicates FDA's policy regarding the exercise of its discretion.
28 The policy statement, along with the precise terms of the statute 29 and a growing body of case law, 30 thus provides this court with more than enough law to apply.
31 Where a court has "law to apply" [**149] agency action is not committed to agency discretion and is subject to judicial review under the APA.
Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe , supra , 401 U.S. at 410 , 91 S.Ct. at 820 .
The District Court did not review the APA's provisions governing judicial review or discuss the case law establishing the strong presumption of reviewability.
Rather, it relied on cases articulating the venerable proposition that courts should not unduly interfere with prosecutorial discretion.
32 But this proposition has never been blindly applied: "[T]he decisions of this court have never allowed the phrase 'prosecutorial discretion' to be treated as a magical incantation which automatically provides a shield for arbitrariness."
Medical Committee for Human Rights v. SEC , 432 F.2d 659, 673 (D.C.Cir.1970), vacated as moot , 404 U.S. 403 , 92 S.Ct. 577 , 30 L.Ed.2d 560 (1972).
33 Indeed, in the last twenty years federal courts have frequently forced agencies to implement and enforce their regulatory statutes, or at least to explain their failure to do so. 34 While the cases the District Court cited are distinguishable from the case at bar, 35 the real "key lies in [**150] recognizing that the law has been in transition and that the case law [is now] strongly on the side of reviewability."
2 K. D AVIS , A DMINISTRATIVE L AW T REATISE 9:6 , at 239-240 (2d ed. 1979).
36 The District Court correctly noted that the "absence of a statutory exemption for state-mandated activity does not logically compel or even suggest that the Commissioner has no discretion to refrain from initiating requested investigative and/or enforcement proceedings *."
Dist.Ct.Op.
at 15, JA 229 (emphasis in original).
But neither does it mean that the Commissioner has absolute discretion in enforcement decisions or that these decisions are insulated from judicial review.
The presumption is in favor of judicial review, and nothing in this case is sufficiently compelling to rebut this presumption.
We must conclude that FDA's inaction here is subject to judicial review.
37 B. Scope of Judicial Review When reviewing informal agency action of this type a court must conduct a "searching and careful" review of the "whole record" to determine if the agency has been "arbitrary or capricious."
See 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A) (1976); FPC v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. , 423 U.S. 326, 331 , 96 S.Ct. 579, 582 , 46 L.Ed.2d 533 (1976) ( per curiam ); Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe , supra , 401 U.S. at 416 , 91 S.Ct. at 823 .
The court must, therefore, make a "searching and careful" review of both the administrative record, [**151] particularly the uncontroverted evidence submitted by appellant, and the agency's stated reasons for its action.
If upon examination the agency record does not satisfy the appropriate standard of judicial review, its action must be vacated.
If FDA's inaction in this case was arbitrary, capricious, and without authority of law, 38 and our own analysis of the record leads us to believe it was, 39 we must remand this case for appropriate action.
First, the Commissioner stated that the "scope of his legal authority" to regulate lethal injections in state capital punishment systems is "highly uncertain."
Brief for appellee at 14.
But this argument simply repeats his meritless contention that FDA did not have jurisdiction in the first place. 40 Moreover, it directly contradicts FDA's own policy statement, issued in 1972 and still in effect, which declares that FDA will investigate and take all necessary action to prevent the unapproved use of approved drugs.
Policy Statement , 37 Fed.Reg.
at 16504 .
The policy statement makes no exception for state-mandated activity, and the Commissioner must provide an acceptable explanation of why his refusal to act in this case is not in contravention of that 1972 statement.
41 So far he has not.
A "good faith" uncertainty about legal authority may be sound reason to decline to bring enforcement proceedings, see brief for appellee at 15, but willful indifference is not.
We do not understand how the Commissioner can assert legal authority to regulate drugs used in both state-licensed clinical investigations and state-licensed veterinary practices and not assert, with equal confidence , authority to regulate drugs used in state-licensed capital punishment practices.
42 It is simply irrational--and thus [**152] arbitrary and capricious--to believe that the agency has jurisdiction over the unapproved use of drugs in the former two practices but not in the latter practice.
Second, the Commissioner asserts that the use of drugs in lethal injections does not pose a "serious danger to the public health."
Brief for appellee at 15.
But he cites no evidence to support this proposition.
Rather, he irrebuttably presumes that "duly authorized statutory enactments [which further] proper State functions" cannot, as a matter of law, pose such a danger to the public.
Letter from the Commissioner at 3, JA 88.
This claim is remarkable in light of the uncontroverted evidence appellants submitted to FDA, which shows that drugs used in lethal injections pose a substantial threat of torturous pain to persons being executed.
R OYAL C OMMISSION ON C APITAL P UNISHMENT , 1949-1953 R EPORT (1953), Exhibit 1 to Letter to the Secretary, JA 34-40.
Furthermore, this claim flies in the face of the Commissioner's admission that FDA has jurisdiction over all state laws "that purport[ ] to legitimize the lawful shipment of an unapproved new drug in interstate commerce or that purport[ ] to permit its misbranding after shipment *."
Brief for appellee at 20 n. 21.
If some state laws can pose a "serious danger to the public health," no state law can be presumed , in the face of substantial evidence to the contrary, not to do so. Rather, FDA can rationally distinguish between laws that do endanger the public health and laws that do not only upon the basis of available evidence.
In this case all the evidence shows that lethal injection laws do endanger users of drugs, and thus the public health.
43 Finally, this claim rationally cannot stand next to FDA's earlier assertions that prisoners in clinical investigations and dogs in veterinary clinics were in "serious danger" from the unapproved use of approved drugs.
If drugs used in these contexts pose a "serious threat" to the public health, then certainly drugs used to kill human beings pose such a threat.
44 In short, the Commissioner presents no rational basis for concluding that lethal injections do not pose a serious health threat.
Thus we must conclude that he has acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and without authority of law. 45 [**153] III.
Conclusion Judge Tamm, writing for this court over a decade ago, once noted that "assertions of discretion inevitably raise questions of degree which must be appraised in the context of the relevant provisions of law and the nature of the particular action sought to be reviewed: '[T]he question is not whether agency action is by law committed to agency discretion but to what extent agency action is so committed.'"
Medical Committee for Human Rights v. SEC , supra , 432 F.2d at 673 ( quoting 4 K. D AVIS , A DMINISTRATIVE L AW T REATISE 33 (1958) (emphasis by Judge Tamm).
Agency enforcement decisions are inevitably based, in large measure, on factors not particularly suitable to judicial resolution, and thus courts give these decisions a great degree of deference.
But courts are also responsible for ensuring that government officials do not negate or frustrate congressional enactments through bureaucratic arbitrariness.
Courts must assure the public that the vast powers agencies exercise are subject to decent and civilized restraints.
46 In this case, despite expert testimony concerning the dangerousness of using barbiturates and paralytics to execute human beings, the Commissioner of FDA refused to take any investigatory or regulatory action.
He provided a glib statement of reasons for the agency's inaction that cannot withstand judicial review.
Hence, we must vacate the District Court's judgment in this case with instructions to order the agency to fulfill its statutory function.
Both this court and the District Court must be mindful that endless litigation, particularly in this case, concerning the sufficiency of the agency's reasons would be inconsistent with the statute's goal of expeditiously protecting consumers from the alleged hazards.
We must be prepared to compel FDA to take action with respect to the prayer for relief where an acceptable explanation of its inaction is not promptly forthcoming.
47 Appellants have presented substantial and uncontroverted evidence to support their claim that execution by lethal injection poses a serious risk of cruel, protracted death.
See R OYAL C OMMISSION ON C APITAL P UNISHMENT , 1949-1953 R EPORT (1953), Exhibit 1 to Letter to the Secretary, supra , JA 34-40.
Even a slight error in dosage or administration can leave a prisoner conscious but paralyzed while dying, a sentient witness of his or her own slow, lingering asphyxiation.
See brief for appellants at 10-11.
In light of these risks, FDA's impermissible refusal to exercise enforcement discretion over the use of drugs for lethal injection--a use well within the jurisdictional ambit of the FDCA, see Part II supra --may also implicate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.
In a civilized society, if we assume as we must that the state may take the life of a person as punishment, decency demands that the life be taken without cruelty.
The Eighth Amendment embodies society's requirement that the means of punishment not be barbarous or torturous, see Gregg v. Georgia , 428 U.S. 153, 167-171 , 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2922-2924 , 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976); In re Kemmler , 136 U.S. 436, 447 , 10 S.Ct. 930, 933 , 34 L.Ed. 519 (1890) [**154] ("punishments are cruel when they involve torture or lingering death"), and the Amendment gives even to those on death row the right to a punishment that is not cruel.
In this case FDA is clearly refusing to exercise enforcement discretion because it does not wish to become embroiled in an issue so morally and constitutionally troubling as the death penalty.
Yet this action amounts to an abnegation of statutory responsibility by the very agency that Congress has charged with the task of ensuring that our people do not suffer harm from misbranded drugs.
See Part III-B supra .
Though this failure to meet statutory responsibilities is alone sufficient to invalidate the FDA's inaction in this case, we note that by failing to exercise its statutory responsibilities FDA also places serious burdens on appellants' right to a death that is not cruel.
As a result of the FDA's inaction, appellants face the risk of a cruel execution and are deprived of the FDA's expert judgment as to the effectiveness of the drugs used for lethal injection, the latter fact making any direct challenge they might bring to this method of execution more difficult.
Thus, even though FDA is not responsible for the execution of these prisoners, its failure to meet its statutory responsibility may well place constitutionally impermissible burdens on the Eighth Amendment rights of appellants.
Vacated and remanded .
