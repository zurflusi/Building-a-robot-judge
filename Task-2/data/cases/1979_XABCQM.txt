 ENGEL , Circuit Judge.
This litigation arises out of efforts by the residents of Hein Park, a subdivision located in Memphis, Tennessee, to close West Drive at its northerly end so as to bar all through traffic.
1 As found by the district court, Hein Park As the map indicates, Springdale Street is, in fact, a northward extension, under another name, of West Drive.
The proposed closing is described by the district court in its opinion: Although the record is uncertain whether the northernmost property owners who are acquiring the east-west strip across the width of West Drive will, in fact, bar all foot traffic as well, it is clear that the proposed conveyance will leave them with the absolute right to do so if they wish, since the property will be private in all respects except for retained rights-of-way for certain service and emergency vehicles and utility easements.
Plaintiffs, certain black individuals and members of a class of black persons in the City of Memphis who own or stand to inherit property immediately to the north of and adjoining the Hein Park area, have attempted from the beginning to prevent the closing.
They principally claim in this lawsuit that the closing of West Drive deliberately creates a barrier between the all-white Hein Park subdivision and the predominantly black residential area to the north, limiting access to and from the latter and impairing their property values.
The closing is claimed to be a violation of their rights under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments; 2 they seek relief under 42 U.S.C. 1982 and 1983.
3 In an earlier appeal, our court reversed a judgment of the district court which dismissed the original complaint for failure to state a claim.
In so doing, we held that the district court relied too heavily on Palmer v. Thompson , 403 U.S. 217 , 91 S.Ct. 1940 , 29 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971), and its ruling that the closings of municipal swimming pools would not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment where it was shown that such closings prevented whites and blacks equally from enjoying the pools.
Greene v. City of Memphis , 535 F.2d 976 (6th Cir. 1976) ( Greene I ).
In remanding, we held that the facts alleged in the complaint, construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, stated claims under 42 U.S.C. 1982 and, even though it had not then been specifically pleaded, under 42 U.S.C. 1983 .
In dicta, our court further observed that: section 1982 Palmer supra solely 403 U.S. at 224 91 S.Ct. at 1944 29 L.Ed.2d at 444 Palmer 403 U.S. at 225 91 S.Ct. at 1945 29 L.Ed.2d at 445 535 F.2d at 979-80 .
Upon remand, amendments to the complaint were filed, certain additional individuals moved and were permitted to intervene as plaintiffs and the court certified this as a class action.
4 Thereafter a bench trial was conducted on the merits before the district judge who on June 21, 1978, entered a judgment in favor of the defendants on all remaining issues.
In doing so, the judge obviously deemed himself confined to the rationale expressed in the dicta of our earlier opinion of reversal.
Thus, his primary focus was on that proof which showed what action was taken by the City of Memphis on petitions filed from time to time by private citizens, white and black, to close streets and alleys within the city.
In this respect the court observed that The court, however, did hold that the proposed closing had a disproportionate impact upon the black citizens, but that the disparate impact was not so stark that a discriminatory motive could be inferred therefrom.
The court stated that Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp. supra 429 U.S. 97 S.Ct. 555 50 L.Ed.2d 450 While ruling against the plaintiffs, the district judge nonetheless entertained serious reservations concerning the wisdom of the proposed closing.
His opinion further stated: The trial judge's observations were supported by the record.
Besides the evidence previously described, included in the evidence before the court were the petitions circulated by the Shankman Hill Civic Club and signed by several hundred citizens residing immediately to the north of West Drive.
Those petitions took note that "[t]his Closing Symbolizes in unmistakable terms a White neighborhood shutting its door on its adjacent Black and integrated Communities."
In a colloquy with counsel for the city, the trial judge indicated his concern: Further showing his extreme skepticism at the proposed closing, the trial court observed: 5 The trial judge also particularly noted in his opinion the testimony of Dr. Marvin Feit, an Assistant Professor at the University of Tennessee Center of Health Sciences, who testified as an expert witness that "closing West Drive would result in negative consequences in the form of hostility toward the people who live in Hein Park, increased vandalism, school harassment, and increased arrests by police."
6 The trial judge additionally relied in his findings upon the testimony of plaintiff's witness, Harold Moore, a licensed real estate broker, to the effect that the proposed closing would be a real benefit to the residents on West Drive.
It is significant, however, that while Moore opined in his original testimony that because of the closing "there would not be a lessening of value in those properties in the Springdale area," his testimony shortly thereafter modified that view considerably: The foregoing citations from the record can only be reconciled with the court's ultimate decision by concluding that the judge believed himself limited in his inquiry on remand to determining whether the proofs showed that in closing West Drive to reduce noise and traffic, the City of Memphis had conferred upon the white residents of West Drive a benefit that it had refused to black citizens when they had applied for similar relief.
If this was, in fact, the limit of the inquiry, the decision must be upheld, for indeed the record did not show that any black resident had ever sought to close a street primarily for purposes of reducing the traffic and contributing to the tranquility of a given neighborhood.
We have considerable sympathy with the trial judge's view of his responsibility on remand since it seems supported at least by the cited dicta of our opinion.
We do not conceive, however, that this was ever the full intent of our earlier decision, and it seems equally clear that the plaintiffs themselves never abandoned their effort to seek relief on a broader basis.
Plaintiffs' posture in their pleadings and throughout the trial was consistent with the closing argument of their counsel: 1982 Section 1982 1982 The "sensitive inquiry" referred to by counsel for the plaintiffs was taken from language of the Supreme Court in Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. , 429 U.S. 252 , 97 S.Ct. 555 , 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977).
There the Supreme Court was faced with the question of whether the refusal of the Village of Arlington Heights to authorize the construction of a public housing project within its boundaries in suburban Chicago was racially discriminatory and violated the Fourteenth Amendment.
As Mr. Justice Powell observed: Washington v. Davis supra 426 U.S. 96 S.Ct. 2040 48 L.Ed.2d 597 Yick Wo v. Hopkins 118 U.S. 356 65 S.Ct. 1064 30 L.Ed. 220 Guinn v. United States 238 U.S. 347 35 S.Ct. 926 59 L.Ed. 1340 Lane v. Wilson 307 U.S. 268 59 S.Ct. 872 83 L.Ed. 1281 Gomillion v. Lightfoot 364 U.S. 339 81 S.Ct. 125 5 L.Ed.2d 110 Gomillion Yick Wo Id. at 266 , 97 S.Ct. at 564 (footnotes omitted).
7 While in his opinion, the trial judge expressly indicated his awareness of Arlington Heights , supra , we believe that he conceived himself limited in his capability to grant relief by the language in Greene I and that he placed too high a threshold upon the requirements of Section 1982 and, underlying it, the Thirteenth Amendment.
In short, we conclude that, upon his own findings and upon the proof credited by him, the pattern of discrimination here was indeed "stark" and was in a very real sense a badge of slavery violative of plaintiffs' rights under the Thirteenth Amendment and subject to relief under 42 U.S.C. 1982 .
8 We readily acknowledge that, as a general proposition, street closings are a matter of purely local concern.
We also recognize that street closings may, indeed, be a very beneficial way of preserving the residential character of a neighborhood against the growing incursion of traffic from outside sources.
Thus we take note of plaintiff's reliance upon Arlington County Board v. Richards , 434 U.S. 5 , 98 S.Ct. 24 , 54 L.Ed.2d 4 (1977), and the Court's observation that: Id. at 7 , 98 S.Ct. at 26 .
We further recognize that not every racially discriminatory act constitutes a badge of slavery.
See e. g. , Civil Rights Cases , 109 U.S. 3, 24-25 , 3 S.Ct. 18 , 27 L.Ed. 835 (1883).
Cf. Runyon v. McCrary , 427 U.S. 160, 211 , 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2614 , 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976) (White, J., dissenting) ("A racially motivated refusal to hire a Negro or a white babysitter or to admit a Negro or a white to a private association cannot be called a badge of slavery .
.
.
.").
Nonetheless, the Supreme Court "recognized long ago that, whatever else they may have encompassed, the badges and incidents of slavery--its 'burdens and disabilities'--included restraints upon 'those fundamental rights which are the essence of civil freedom .
. '"
Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. , 392 U.S. 409, 441 , 88 S.Ct. 2186, 2204 , 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (quoting Civil Rights Cases , supra , 109 U.S. at 22 , 3 S.Ct. 18 ).
9 We are convinced that the erection of the physical barrier between a historically all-white residential neighborhood and a predominantly black neighborhood under the particular circumstances found by the court here is precisely the type of "badge" which was the target of the Thirteenth Amendment and of Section 1982 .
10 The broad reach of Section 1982 was repeatedly emphasized by Mr. Justice Stewart in Jones , supra , 392 U.S. at 422-37 , 88 S.Ct. 2186 .
As the Supreme Court later observed in Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc. , 396 U.S. 229, 237 , 90 S.Ct. 400, 404 , 24 L.Ed.2d 386 (1969), "[a] narrow construction of the language of 1982 would be inconsistent with the broad and sweeping nature of the protection meant to be afforded by [the Act]."
42 U.S.C. 1982 was enacted under authority of Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment.
11 Jones , supra , 392 U.S. at 413 , 88 S.Ct. 2186 .
Congress therein determined that the disability of blacks to enjoy property in the same manner as whites was a badge and incident of slavery.
Id. at 439 , 88 S.Ct. 2186 .
12 While the Supreme Court has not often been required to define "badge of slavery" under the Thirteenth Amendment, it is clear that many badges of slavery either were a part of the recent past or remain a part of the present.
As Mr. Justice Douglas stated: e. g. Lane v. Wilson 307 U.S. 268 59 S.Ct. 872 83 L.Ed. 1281 e. g. Strauder v. West Virginia 100 U.S. 303 25 L.Ed. 664 Johnson v.

v. Detiege 358 U.S. 54 79 S.Ct. 99 3 L.Ed.2d 46 Lombard v. Louisiana 373 U.S. 267 83 S.Ct. 1122 10 L.Ed.2d 338 Mayor of Baltimore v. Dawson 350 U.S. 877 76 S.Ct. 133 100 L.Ed. 774 Holmes v. City of Atlanta 350 U.S. 879 76 S.Ct. 141 100 L.Ed. 776 Griffin v. Maryland 378 U.S. 130 84 S.Ct. 1770 12 L.Ed.2d 754 Gayle v. Browder 352 U.S. 903 77 S.Ct. 145 1 L.Ed.2d 114 Brown v. Louisiana 383 U.S. 131 86 S.Ct. 719 15 L.Ed.2d 637 Hamilton v. Alabama 376 U.S. 650 84 S.Ct. 982 11 L.Ed.2d 979 Jones , supra , 392 U.S. at 445-46 , 88 S.Ct. at 2206 (concurring opinion).
The closing of West Drive is merely another device leading to the same result.
It would be, to blacks and whites alike, exactly what the trial judge said it was: an unmistakable warning to the black people living to the north of West Drive to stay out of the Hein Park subdivision.
"[W]hen racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery."
Jones , supra , 392 U.S. at 442-43 , 88 S.Ct. at 2205 .
Without endeavoring to establish any legal guidelines for the determination of when conduct may amount to a badge of slavery, we find the determinations made by the district court here to be altogether adequate to bring the conduct complained of within that description.
The community to be benefited by the closing was and had historically been all white.
Conversely, the territory to be burdened by the closing was predominantly black.
The barrier was to be erected precisely at the point of separation of these neighborhoods and would undoubtedly have the effect of limiting contact between them.
The proposed closing was not enacted in response to any uniform city planning effort, directed generally to the preservation of the residential neighborhoods throughout the city; instead it appears to have been a unique step to protect one neighborhood from outside influences which the residents considered to be "undesirable."
Finally, there was some evidence, credited by the district court, of an economic depreciation in the property values in the predominantly black residential area with a corresponding increase in the property values in Hein Park.
The result, under the unique circumstances here, can only be seen as one more of the many humiliations which society has historically visited upon blacks.
Where that racial humiliation not only rises to the level of a badge of slavery but also affects the right of blacks to hold property in the same manner as other citizens, then Section 1982 has been violated and the federal courts must provide a suitable remedy. 13 OTHER ISSUES In addition to their Sections 1982 and 1983 claims, the plaintiffs raised certain pendent state claims.
The district court held that "the evidence does not support a recovery under these or any other theory under the law of Tennessee."
The appellants have not questioned that decision in this appeal; we therefore have not considered it.
The plaintiffs also sought a decree that the defendants should be required to cause sidewalks, curbs and gutters to be installed on West Drive.
The district court found no basis for such relief and we agree.
We likewise agree with the district court's decision that the plaintiffs failed to prove their claim of a violation of their rights to procedural due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.
CONCLUSION In conclusion we hold that under the unique circumstances shown here, the erection of the barrier at the northerly boundary of West Drive constitutes a badge of slavery adversely affecting the ability of the plaintiffs to hold and enjoy their property, in violation of their rights under the Thirteenth Amendment and entitling them to a remedy under Section 1982 .
14 Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the cause remanded for the fashioning of appropriate injunctive relief.
