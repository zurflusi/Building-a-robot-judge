 BRIGHT , Circuit Judge.
The question presented by this case is whether federal labor policy preempts the legislative power of the State of Minnesota to impose upon the White Motor Corporation 1 (White Motor) the obligation to fully fund its employee pension plan upon the closing of its factory and terminating its employees, notwithstanding an agreement to the contrary contained in the collective bargaining contract between White Motor and the employees' unions.
The district court answered this preemption question in the negative 2 and denied White Motor injunctive relief barring enforcement of the questioned Minnesota legislation, referred to here as the Minnesota Pension Act.
3 We disagree, and hold that the Minnesota Pension Act, as applied to White Motor, is preempted by federal labor policy.
We have earlier considered other problems relating to White Motor's pension plan.
4 The historical facts related there are a prelude to the present litigation.
White Motor closed its Minneapolis factory and attempted to terminate as of June 30, 1972, the pension plan benefiting employees at the Minneapolis plant and employees at another White Motor factory in Hopkins, Minnesota.
The UAW (Union) challenged the action contending that the pension plan could not be terminated prior to May 1, 1974, the expiration date of the collective bargaining agreement then in effect.
An arbitrator ruled in favor of the Union, and the federal district court sustained the award as within the arbitrator's powers granted under terms of the collective bargaining agreement.
On appeal, we affirmed.
During that prior litigation, White Motor took appropriate action to terminate the pension plan as of May 1, 1974, if the arbitrator's determination should be sustained.
5 During the pendency of the preceding litigation, the Minnesota legislature enacted the Minnesota Pension Act, effective April 10, 1974.
6 The statute requires full funding of pension benefits whenever an employer ceases to operate a place of employment or pension plan.
The district court described and interpreted the relevant statutory provisions as follows: Minn.Stat.
181B.03-.06 Minn.Stat.
181B.09-.12 181B.11 White Motor Corp. v. Malone 412 F.Supp.
372, 375 Pursuant to applicable provisions of the Minnesota Pension Act, the State of Minnesota notified White Motor that the corporation owed a pension funding charge of $19,150,053.
White Motor's obligations as to vesting and, particularly, as to funding under the pension plan differed significantly from obligations imposed on employers by the Minnesota Pension Act.
The district court described the history of White Motor's plan and discussed the differences in obligations imposed on the employer by its plan, as compared to the statutory obligations under Minnesota law, as follows: Section 9.05 Section 6.09--Source of Pensions Section 6.17--No Other Benefits Section 9.04--Rights of Employees in the Fund White Motor v. Malone supra 412 F.Supp.
at 373-75 The Minnesota Pension Act obligations conflict with White Motor's pension plan provisions in the following respects: (1) the Act grants employees vested rights to pension benefits which are not available under the pension plan; (2) to the extent of any deficiency in the pension fund, the Act requires satisfaction of pension benefits from the general assets of the employer, while the pension plan provides that benefits shall be paid only out of the pension fund; and (3) the Act does not permit employers to escape liability for funding of pension rights, but the pension plan permits White Motor to terminate the plan at any time, and in so doing end any liability for future payments to the pension fund, save those specifically guaranteed.
Thus, essential features of the pension plan, deferred funding of past service liability 7 coupled with limited employer liability and the power to terminate, were negated by the Pension Act.
The district court rejected White Motor's summary judgment motion for a declaration of invalidity of the Pension Act on preemption grounds, and for relief by way of a temporary injunction against its enforcement, reasoning that, San Diego Building Trades Council v.] Garmon 359 U.S. 236 79 S.Ct. 773 3 L.Ed.2d 775 White Motor Corp. v. Malone supra 412 F.Supp.
at 379 Additionally, the district court determined the preemption doctrine was inapplicable to pension plans, on the ground that Congress in the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act, Pub.L.
No. 85-836, 72 Stat. 997 (1958) (codified at 29 U.S.C. 301 et seq.
), as amended, explicitly recognized state power over pension plan "operation" or "administration."
In that regard the district court wrote: 29 U.S.C. 309(b) to leave regulatory responsibilty to the States to leave to the States the detailed regulations relating to insurance, trusts, and other phases of their operations U.S.

at 380-81 We disagree.
The Minnesota Pension Act directly intrudes upon the employer's substantive obligations under the pension plan, obligations arrived at freely through collective bargaining, and appears in its operation to be a unique legislative act.
The Supreme Court's holdings and decisions in the area of federal labor law preemption require reversal.
Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act ( 29 U.S.C. 157 ) establishes the right of employees to form and join labor organizations and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing.
Sections 8(a)(5) , 8(b)(3), and 8(d) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended ( 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(5) , 158(b)(3), and 158(d)), require employers and labor organizations to bargain in good faith with respect to "wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment *."
Pension plans fall within the category of "wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment," and are therefore mandatory subjects of bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act.
Inland Steel Co. v. NLRB , 170 F.2d 247 (7th Cir. 1948), cert. denied , 336 U.S. 960 , 69 S.Ct. 887 , 93 L.Ed. 1112 (1949).
Congress, in enacting the NLRA, refrained from specifying those aspects of labor relations which are not subject to state interference.
Thus, a considerable body of law has developed in which the courts have determined when state action affecting collective bargaining is impermissible.
The United States Supreme Court recently reviewed and discussed these cases in Lodge 76, Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission , 427 U.S. 132 , 96 S.Ct. 2548 , 49 L.Ed.2d 396 (1976).
Mr. Justice Brennan, speaking for the majority of the Court, noted the general division of cases into two categories: Machinists supra 427 U.S. at 138 96 S.Ct. at 2552 The decision in Machinists focused on the second category.
The Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission had ordered a union to cease and desist from "authorizing, encouraging or condoning any considered refusal to accept overtime assignments" from the employer after the termination of the previous collective bargaining agreement, and during negotiations for a new agreement, and the Wisconsin courts had entered a judgment enforcing the Commission's order.
8 The Machinists appeal to the Supreme Court presented the question whether federal labor policy preempted the authority of the state Labor Relations Board to enjoin a union and its members from refusing to work overtime in order to put economic pressure on the employer in negotiations for renewal of an expired collective bargaining agreement.
The Court deemed this controversy as falling into the second line of preemption cases, i. e. , those "focusing upon the crucial inquiry whether Congress intended that the conduct involved be unregulated because 'left to be controlled by the free play of economic forces.'"
Machinists , supra , 427 U.S. at 140 , 96 S.Ct. at 2553 .
The Wisconsin Supreme Court in upholding the injunction had relied on the so-called Briggs-Stratton case, Local 232 Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Board , 336 U.S. 245 , 69 S.Ct. 516 , 93 L.Ed. 651 (1949).
Briggs-Stratton held that state power was not preempted as to peaceful conduct neither protected by 7 nor prohibited by 8 of the Act, a holding premised on the statement that "[t]his conduct is either governable by the state or it is entirely ungoverned."
Machinists , supra , 427 U.S. at 141 , 96 S.Ct. at 2553 , quoting Briggs-Stratton , supra , 336 U.S. at 254 , 69 S.Ct. 516 .
The Machinists opinion observed that the underpinning of Briggs-Stratton had been undercut by subsequent decisions of the Court 7 any NLRB v. Insurance Agents 361 U.S. 80 S.Ct. 4 L.Ed.2d 454 Machinists supra 427 U.S. at 141 96 S.Ct. at 2553-54 The Machinists decision expressly overruled the Briggs-Stratton decision as having been worn away by contrary authority.
Machinists , supra , 427 U.S. at 154 , 96 S.Ct. at 2560 .
The Machinists case and the cases relied on in Machinists 9 considered the power of states to regulate conduct by employers and employees constituting economic weapons used in the collective bargaining process.
The Machinists opinion deemed the Court's earlier decision in NLRB v. Insurance Agents , 361 U.S. 477 , 80 S.Ct. 419 , 4 L.Ed.2d 454 (1960), as substantial precedent for overruling Briggs-Stratton .
In Insurance Agents , on-the-job activities by union members interfered with the employer's business, and thus put economic pressure on the employer to accede to the union's bargaining demands.
The NLRB held that proof of these tactics justified its determination that the union had failed to bargain in good faith as required by 8(b)(3) of the NLRA.
The Supreme Court disagreed: the Government might have to enter even more directly into the negotiation of collective agreements.
Our labor policy is not presently erected on a foundation of government control of the results of negotiations Insurance Agents supra 361 U.S. at 488, 490 80 S.Ct. at 426 Machinists , in its review of pertinent Supreme Court cases, 10 makes it abundantly clear that neither the states nor the National Labor Relations Board may attempt to influence the substantive terms of collective bargaining agreements by regulating the conduct of the parties to collective bargaining negotiations.
These agreements are to be controlled by and left to the free play of economic forces.
If states cannot control the economic weapons of the parties at the bargaining table, a fortiori , they may not directly control the substantive terms of the contract which results from that bargaining.
Appellant in seeking reversal relies heavily on Local 24, Teamsters v. Oliver , 358 U.S. 283 , 79 S.Ct. 297 , 3 L.Ed.2d 312 (1959).
Oliver holds that by reason of the preemption doctrine, a state antitrust statute cannot apply to negate terms of a collective bargaining agreement setting wage rates.
In that case, a collective bargaining agreement between a group of labor unions and a group of interstate motor carriers prescribed a wage scale for truck drivers and, in order to prevent evasion thereof, provided that truck owner-drivers should be paid, in addition to the prescribed wage, not less than a specified minimum rental for the use of their vehicles.
Respondent Oliver, a truck owner-driver member of the union had obtained an injunction in the state court, affirmed by the Ohio Supreme Court, to prevent the motor carriers and the local union from carrying out the minimum rent provision on the ground that such term of the collective bargaining agreement violated Ohio antitrust laws.
The Supreme Court reversed.
The state antitrust law could not be applied to bar the contracting parties from carrying out of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement upon a subject as to which federal law directed them to bargain.
The Court said: Labor Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. 301 U.S. 1, 45 57 S.Ct. 615, 628 81 L.Ed. 893 Labor Board v. American National Ins. Co. 343 U.S. 395, 401-402 72 S.Ct. 824, 828 96 L.Ed. 1027 Oliver supra 358 U.S. at 295 79 S.Ct. at 304 Specifically focusing on the threatened impact of the state law on the collective bargaining process, the court said: Oliver supra 358 U.S. at 295-97 79 S.Ct. at 304 The district court rejected Oliver as dispositive in this case, stating: See, e. g. Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers & Steamfitters 421 U.S. 616 95 S.Ct. 1830 44 L.Ed.2d 418 Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc. 348 U.S. 468 75 S.Ct. 480 99 L.Ed. 546 Connell supra 421 U.S. at 636 95 S.Ct. at 1842 44 L.Ed.2d at 434 Oliver White Motor Corp. v. Malone supra 412 F.Supp.
at 381 In our view, Oliver is not to be read so restrictively.
We emphasize the Court's language: Oliver supra 358 U.S. at 296 79 S.Ct. at 305 Moreover, in Labor Board v. Insurance Agents , the Court cited Oliver in support of the following statement: Teamsters Union v. Oliver supra 358 U.S. at 295 79 S.Ct. at page 304 Insurance Agents supra 361 U.S. at 488 80 S.Ct. at 426 The Supreme Court in Machinists also relied on specific language in Oliver as a basis for overruling Briggs-Stratton .
Briggs-Stratton Local 24 of International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, A.F.L.-C.I.O v. Oliver 358 U.S. 283, 296 79 S.Ct. 297, 305 Machinists supra 427 U.S. at 153 96 S.Ct. at 2559 Thus, Oliver stands for the general proposition that a state cannot modify or change an otherwise valid and effective provision of a collective bargaining agreement.
Finally, we turn to the district court determination that the federal Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act, Pub.L.
No. 85-836, 72 Stat. 997 (1958) (codified at 29 U.S.C. 301 et seq. )
(Disclosure Act), expressly authorizes substantive state regulation of pension plans.
The statutory language relied on by the district court is as follows: 29 U.S.C. 309(b) 11 Neither this language nor statutory history suggests that Congress intended to regulate substantive provisions, performance of, or the funding of any employee benefit plan or to authorize such regulation by the states.
The express statutory language relied upon by the district court applies to duties and liabilities, civil or criminal, imposed upon persons operating and administering employee welfare or pension benefit plans to conserve and keep safe those funds.
The legislative history emphasizes the limited purpose of this legislation and that the Act's provisions do not affect substantive terms of employee benefit plans.
We turn to the Senate Report as the Senate Bill was passed in lieu of the House Bill.
See 3 U.S.
Code Cong. & Adm.
News p. 4137 (1958).
That Senate Report, in part, reads: Id. at p. 4153 In further discussion of the principles and purposes of the Senate Bill, the Report adds: Id .
Additionally, the report discusses criminal penalties and, in that discussion, expressly negates any purpose of the enactment to regulate substantive provisions: Id. at p. 4157 Clearly, the preemption disclaimer provision of the Disclosure Act, 309(b) , relates to state statutes governing those obligations of trust undertaken by persons managing, administrating, or operating employee benefit funds, the violation of which gives rise to civil and criminal penalties.
Accordingly, no warrant exists for construing this legislation to leave to a state the power to change substantive terms of pension plan agreements.
The construction to the contrary pressed upon us by the appellee would turn upside down well-established labor law principles.
Labor Law Preemption Revisited 85 Harv.L.Rev.
1337 The economic travail suffered by retirees of the former Minnesota Moline Company plant in Minneapolis, Minnesota, did not result from misapplication, misappropriation, or misuse of any pension trust funds.
The employees' expectation of pension benefits remained subject to change by reason of changing economic conditions, because the employer reserved the right to terminate the plan.
Blame cannot be attached to either the Union or the employer for the changed economic conditions which resulted in the closing of the Lake Street plant and the termination of the pension plan.
The parties (union and employer) agreed upon a pension plan that was never fully funded, or otherwise guaranteed.
We presume that the parties agreed to increase current wages, perhaps at the expense of adequately funding retirement benefits.
If the legislative solution presented here can be sustained, then in another day a differently-minded state legislature could take away from working people contract benefits obtained through hard, fair bargaining.
We construe national labor policy to mandate "hands off" by the states in this area of labor relations.
We reverse and remand for the entry of judgment in conformity with this opinion.
