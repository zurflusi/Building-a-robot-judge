 BUFFINGTON , Circuit Judge.
The proposed order of the National Labor Relations Board, so far as clauses 1, 2, 3, and 5 are concerned, is approved.
Sections (a) and (b) of clause 4 are approved, but approval is withheld from sections (c) and (d) of said clause, which read: "(c) Withdraw all recognition from the Employees Association of the Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, Inc., as representative of their employees, including the employees of the Pennsylvania Greyhound System, for the purpose of dealing with respondents concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work; "(d) Post notices in conspicuous places in all of the places of business wherein their employees, including employees of the Pennsylvania Greyhound System, are engaged, stating that said Association is so disestablished and that respondents will refrain from any such recognition thereof."
The majority of the court feels that sections (c) and (d) should not be enforced because there is no warrant in the act for such action.
No election has been held; the union enjoined has not been notified or heard, but, in advance of an election by the men, said union is for all practical purposes outlawed, and that without hearing.
