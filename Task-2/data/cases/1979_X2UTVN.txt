 J. JOSEPH SMITH , Circuit Judge: This is an appeal from dismissal by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Henry F. Werker, Judge, of an action for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(k) .
We find error and reverse and remand for allowance of attorney's fees.
This is a case of first impression involving the right of a successful party to collect attorney's fees under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.
, for proceedings at the state administrative level.
Based on the statutory scheme of Title VII, the legislative history and public policy, we reverse the denial below of an attorney's fee award, and hold that such a successful party is entitled to counsel fees under Title VII.
Facts Appellant Cidni Carey applied for a position as a waitress with appellee New York Gaslight Club, Inc. in 1974.
She was not offered a job.
Believing that she was denied a position because of her race, Carey filed a complaint with the New York office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC").
Carey's complaint was referred to the New York State Division of Human Rights by the EEOC, in accordance with the statutory scheme of deferring to state mechanisms for resolving discrimination charges under Title VII.
42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(c) .
Carey then filed a formal complaint with the state Division of Human Rights, at that agency's request.
The state agency made a finding of jurisdiction and probable cause that unlawful discrimination had taken place.
After conciliation efforts had failed, Carey's case was recommended for a public hearing.
A hearing was held, concluding in January, 1976.
In August, 1976 the Division of Human Rights issued an order finding that the Gaslight Club had unlawfully discriminated against Carey on the basis of her race.
The Division also directed the Club to offer Carey a waitress position and to award her back pay.
The Gaslight Club appealed this order to the New York State Human Rights Appeal Board, which affirmed the finding of discrimination and order for relief.
This decision was also affirmed by the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court.
59 App.Div.2d 852 , 399 N.Y.S.2d 158 (1st Dept.
1977).
The New York Court of Appeals subsequently denied leave to appeal in February, 1978.
43 N.Y.2d 648 , 403 N.Y.S.2d 1026 , 374 N.E.2d 630 (1978).
The EEOC was not directly involved in any of the state proceedings dealing with Carey's complaint.
Carey's counsel 1 communicated with the EEOC to inform that office of the course of the state proceedings.
In July, 1977 Carey received a Notice of Right to Sue Letter from the EEOC.
Within the statutorily required 90-day period, 2 Carey filed a suit in federal district court.
In the district court, the only issue presented by Carey was the award of attorney's fees based on her success at the state administrative level, following referral to the state agency by the EEOC.
Judge Werker denied the request for attorney's fees, holding that Carey could have been represented by a state-provided attorney if she had wished, and that the filing of a federal court suit while the state administrative claim was still pending did not warrant an award of attorney's fees.
For the reasons below, we reverse and remand for consideration of an award of counsel fees.
DISCUSSION Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."
42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.
The statute sets forth a detailed scheme of enforcement by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
42 U.S.C. 2000e-5 .
3 Section 706(k) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(k) , provides that The purpose of this provision for counsel fees is to facilitate the bringing of individual complaints in order to "effectuate the congressional policy against .
.
discrimination."
Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express , 488 F.2d 714, 716 (5th Cir. 1974).
See also , Christianburg Garment Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , 434 U.S. 412, 418 , 98 S.Ct. 694 , 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978).
Such a statute which provides for attorney's fees awards in civil rights cases is aimed at enforcing congressional mandates against discrimination through private actions and should be read "broadly to achieve its remedial purpose."
Mid-Hudson Legal Services, Inc. v. G & U, Inc. , 578 F.2d 34, 37 (2d Cir. 1978).
4 Though 706(k) on its surface provides for awards of counsel fees at the court's discretion, the policy developed by the Supreme Court favors awards of fees to successful plaintiffs unless there are special circumstances which would render such an award unjust.
See Christianburg Garment Co. , supra , 434 U.S. at 416-17 , 98 S.Ct. 694 .
This approach stems from a recognition that it is in the public interest to aid Title VII enforcement through private actions, and a liberal reading of the attorney's fees provision encourages this effort.
Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody , 422 U.S. 405, 415 , 95 S.Ct. 2362 , 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975), citing Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises , 390 U.S. 400 , 88 S.Ct. 964 , 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968) (per curiam), and Northcross v. Memphis Board of Education , 412 U.S. 427 , 93 S.Ct. 2201 , 37 L.Ed.2d 48 (1973) (per curiam).
Accord , Rios v. Enterprise Association Steamfitters Local 638 of U. A. , 400 F.Supp.
993, 995 (S.D.N.Y.1975), aff'd 542 F.2d 579 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. denied , 430 U.S. 911 , 97 S.Ct. 1186 , 51 L.Ed.2d 588 (1977).
The issue in this case, then, is whether the general policy of awarding attorney's fees to successful plaintiffs in Title VII actions envisions an award to a party who is successful in pursuing her claim before the state human rights agency without having to pursue her case in federal court.
There is no real question that Carey prevailed on the merits before the Division of Human Rights.
5 The question is whether 706(k) encompasses fee awards to complaining parties who succeed at a step in the statutory scheme before they are forced to litigate their claims in federal court.
Deference to state mechanisms for resolving discrimination complaints is an integral part of the enforcement process under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(c) , and submission to state remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to EEOC action.
See Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Union Bank , 408 F.2d 867, 869 (9th Cir. 1968).
The statutory framework of Title VII embodies a "federal mandate of accommodation to state action."
Voutsis v. Union Carbide Corp. , 452 F.2d 889, 892 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied , 406 U.S. 918 , 92 S.Ct. 1768 , 32 L.Ed.2d 117 (1972).
Thus, there can be concurrent jurisdiction over a complaint by the EEOC and the state agency, Voutsis , supra , 452 F.2d at 892 .
In addition, oral referral to a state agency of a complaint filed with the EEOC acts to place the complaint in "suspended animation" until the state has terminated proceedings and "fully complie[s] with the intent" of Title VII.
Love v. Pullman Co. , 404 U.S. 522, 525-6 , 92 S.Ct. 616 , 30 L.Ed.2d 679 (1972).
As explained in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co. , 415 U.S. 36, 44 , 94 S.Ct. 1011, 1017 , 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974), the enforcement procedures in Title VII were designed to Thus, state human rights agencies play an important role in the enforcement process of Title VII, since they afford a chance to resolve a discrimination complaint in accordance with federal policy before such a complaint reaches the federal courts.
The language of 706(k) refers to attorney's fees awards in "any action or proceeding under this subchapter."
The subchapter does include the description of deferral to state agencies by the EEOC, and uses the term "proceeding" to describe the state processes.
42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(c) .
In light of this, and in light of the use of both "action" and "proceeding" in 706(k) , 6 the language of the statute is broad enough to encompass awards of counsel fees for work done in connection with administrative proceedings following referral to a state agency by EEOC.
7 Other circuits favor a broad reading of the attorney's fees provisions of Title VII to include compensation for work done in administrative proceedings.
Fischer v. Adams , 572 F.2d 406 (1st Cir. 1978); Parker v. Califano , 182 U.S.App.D.C.
322 , 561 F.2d 320 (1977); Foster v. Boorstin , 182 U.S.App.D.C.
342 , 561 F.2d 340 (1977).
Accord , Noble v. Claytor , 448 F.Supp.
1242 (D.D.C.1978); Smith v. Califano , 446 F.Supp.
530 (D.D.C.1978); McMullen v. Warner , 416 F.Supp.
1163 (D.D.C.1976).
While these cases deal with federal employees involved in federal agency procedures, their reasoning supports a similarly favorable result for complainants who succeed in state administrative proceedings pursuant to Title VII.
8 While the complaint resolution process may be factually different for federal complainants than for private employees, the policy reasons for allowing attorney's fees awards for work done on the administrative level are similar for federal and private employees who claim discrimination in violation of Title VII.
First, the fact that the opposing party in an administrative hearing will most likely be represented by an attorney is as true in the case of an individual filing a charge against a private employer as it is in the case of a federal employee.
See Parker v. Califano , supra , 182 U.S.App.D.C.
at 334 , 561 F.2d at 332 .
In the case of a private employer, the disadvantage at which an individual employee who is not represented by counsel would be placed in a state administrative hearing is potentially every bit as great as that of a federal employee confronting a United States agency.
Judge Werker ruled below that the need to award attorney's fees in the case of private individuals was not as pressing as in the case of federal employees, since a private complainant appearing before the New York Division of Human Rights could have the option of being represented by counsel provided by the Division.
In this regard, he cited 297(4)(a) of the New York Executive Law (Human Rights), McKinney 1972, which provides that the "case in support of the complaint shall be presented by one of the attorneys or agents of the [D]ivision."
We disagree with this conclusion.
A brief filed before this court by the New York Division of Human Rights as amicus curiae points out that the statute provides for Division lawyers to present the case "in support of the complaint," not in support of the plaintiff.
Thus, there may be cases in which the position of the Division lawyer is not the same as that of the complaining party.
In addition, as noted by the Division, state attorneys are available to represent complaining parties only at the public hearing stage of the administrative process.
In the earlier investigative stage no Division attorney is provided to represent a private employee and in the later appellate stage a Division attorney, if one appears, does so as an advocate of the decision rendered by the New York State Division of Human Rights or of the Appeal Board, which may have denied the employee's claim or granted less relief than the complainant sought.
The need to retain private counsel at the state administrative stage in a Title VII claim is therefore real.
If no counsel is present to represent a complainant at the investigative stage, her complaint may never receive a public hearing because there may be no finding of probable cause or jurisdiction.
And if a plaintiff cannot obtain representation at the appellate stage, she may be deprived of review of her claim, and may be forced to pursue her case in federal court even where a resolution through state mechanisms might be possible.
9 Second, denial of awards of attorney's fees for administrative proceedings may encourage needless litigation.
10 As noted in Smith v. Califano , supra , 446 F.Supp.
at 534 : Awards of attorney's fees for administrative work further the congressional policy of resolving discrimination complaints before they reach the federal courts just as effectively in cases involving state agencies as in those involving federal agencies.
Given the compromise worked out by Congress to provide some deference to state dispute resolution mechanisms, see Voutsis v. Union Carbide Corp. , supra , 452 F.2d at 891-92 , an interpretation of the attorney's fees provision which favors parties who are successful in state administrative proceedings to the same extent as those who prevail in court is consistent with the legislative intent just as is allowing counsel fees in the context of federal administrative proceedings.
Finally, the importance of providing an incentive for a complete development of the administrative record is as relevant to state administrative proceedings as to federal ones.
See Smith v. Califano , supra , 446 F.Supp.
at 534 .
If a complaining party is reluctant to present her case fully before a state agency for fear that success at that level would deprive her of an attorney's fee award, the federal courts will not have the benefit of a complete record below when reviewing the case.
Thus, courts will have to expend time and energy which might be unnecessary if plaintiffs had an incentive to develop a full administrative record.
The cases cited by appellees for the proposition that attorney's fees under Title VII may be awarded only for success in a courtroom context are not applicable to the case at bar.
Neither Pearson v. Western Electric Co. , 542 F.2d 1150 (10th Cir. 1976), nor Williams v. General Foods Corp. , 492 F.2d 399 (7th Cir. 1974), deals with a party who prevailed in administrative proceedings undertaken pursuant to the requirements of Title VII.
To the extent that the language of those cases limits recovery of attorney's fees under Title VII to parties who succeed in a court, it is inconsistent with the reasoning of the cases we have cited in the area and we decline to adopt that limitation.
See Fischer v. Adams , supra , 572 F.2d 406 ; Parker v. Califano , supra , and cases cited therein, 182 U.S.App.D.C.
326 n. 13, 561 F.2d at 324 n. 13; Drew v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. , 480 F.2d 69 (5th Cir. 1973), cert. denied , 417 U.S. 935 , 94 S.Ct. 2650 , 41 L.Ed.2d 239 (1974).
A complaining party who is successful in state administrative proceedings after having her complaint under Title VII referred to a state agency in accordance with the statutory scheme of that Title is entitled to recover attorney's fees in the same manner as a party who prevails in federal court.
We reverse and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
