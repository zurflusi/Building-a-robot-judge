 PER CURIAM.
On the trial of Henry L. Peckham, Jr., under the abortion statute of the District of Columbia, Dorsey K. Offutt, Esq., was defense counsel.
At the end of the trial the presiding judge summarily found Offutt guilty of criminal contempt of court and ordered him committed for 10 days to the custody of the United States Marshal.
Offutt appeals from that order.
We quote from the order: When whether [**150] duces tecum Most of these findings are followed by several references to the record.
The record amply supports the quoted findings numbered 1, 2, 6, and 12 1 and the ultimate finding of contempt.
But we think the record does not support the penalty imposed.
2 Appellant's conduct cannot fairly be considered apart from that of the trial judge.
Each responded to great provocation from the other.
The judge's treatment of appellant, examples of which are included in an appendix to our opinion in Peckham v. United States , U.S.App.D.C., F.2d , and which is the chief factor in leading a majority of this court to conclude that Peckham's conviction cannot stand, leads us all to conclude that appellant's sentence should be reduced from 10 days to 48 hours.
The order will be modified accordingly.
Modified and affirmed.
