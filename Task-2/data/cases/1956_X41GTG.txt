 PICKETT , Circuit Judge.
The Trustee in Bankruptcy for Frank Melvin Thompson brought this action against Safeway Stores, Inc., to recover treble damages under 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C.A. 13a.
1 The complaint is based solely upon violations of the second and third clauses of 3, wherein it is alleged that Safeway made sales at unreasonably low prices and territorial discrimination in prices for the purpose of injuring competition to the damage of Thompson, who at the time was in the retail grocery business in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
It suffices to say that the allegations, if true, constituted violations of 3.
The trial court expressed doubt as to the constitutionality of 3, but chose to base its conclusion on a holding that the section was no part of the antitrust statutes of the United States, and dismissed the action on the ground that a civil action for treble damages was not available to a private litigant under 15 U.S.C.A. 15.
We do not agree with this conclusion.
15 U.S.C.A. 15 was included in the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, and provides that "any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, *" together with reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
The Clayton Act defined "antitrust laws" as designated statutes existing at the time.
Upon codification this section became 15 U.S.C.A. 12, and defined "antitrust laws" as sections 1-27 of Title 15.
It is contended that 13a was not one of those antitrust laws as defined in 1 of the Clayton Act and the codifiers could not amend the law by including it in 12.
This is no doubt true if 3 is a separate act.
The code is only prima facie evidence of the law, and the language of the original statute controls.

If, however, 3 is in fact an amendment to the Clayton Act, it was properly designated in the codification.
To be an amendment to an existing law, the statute need not be so labeled.
A law is amended when it is permitted to remain and something is added or taken from it or is in some way changed or altered to better accomplish its purpose.

In holding that 3 was not an amendment to the Clayton Act but a separate Act for which a civil remedy was not available to the plaintiff under 15, the trial court relied to a large extent upon the legislative history of the Act.
Safeway here insists that the history sustains the trial court, while the Trustee maintains the opposite view.
We think a study of the committee reports, the discussions and debates on the Robinson-Patman Act, both in the House and Senate, leads to the conclusion that it was generally understood at the time that 3 of that Act was supplementary and amendatory of the antitrust laws and that in addition to the criminal sanctions, an injured party could recover treble damages under the provisions of the Clayton Act.
The Act dealt exclusively with the subject matter of the existing antitrust laws.
It was a continuation of the Congressional attack upon the evils of combinations, monopolies and restraints of trade and commerce designed to stifle competition.
In each instance "'Congress was dealing with competition, which it sought to protect, and monopolies which it sought to prevent'".

The title to the Act states that it is an act to amend 2 of the Clayton Act, and for other purposes, but the enacting clause recites only that 2 "is amended to read as follows:" and the entire Robinson-Patman Act follows, although the first section, designated as 2, is in quotation marks, while the last three sections are not.
We do not think that failure to include the last three sections in quotation marks has the significance which the trial court gave to it, because these sections are not referred to in any other manner than in the enacting clause.
Without specific language excluding these three sections from the enacting clause, we feel constrained to hold that they are included thereunder and must be considered as amending the Clayton Act.
In Balian Ice Cream Co. v. Arden Farms Co. , supra , Judge Yankwich, in a thorough and painstaking review of antitrust legislation and the authorities, concluded that 3 was an amendment of the Clayton Act and upheld the right of a private litigant to sue for treble damages under 15.
We adopt the reasoning and conclusions reached in that case. Generally the courts which have had occasion to consider the question have agreed that the recovery of treble damages was available to private litigants for violation of 13a.

Although it was not necessary to a decision in the case, the Supreme Court, in Bruce's Juices, Inc., v. American Can Co. , 330 U.S. 743, 750 , 67 S.Ct. 1015, 1018 , 91 L.Ed. 1219 , had this to say: Considering the result in Moore v. Mead Service Co. (Fine Bread Co.) , 10 Cir., 184 F.2d 338 , vacated and remanded 340 U.S. 944, 945 , 71 S.Ct. 528 , 95 L.Ed. 681 , and 10 Cir., 208 F.2d 777 , reversed 348 U.S. 115 , 75 S.Ct. 148 , 99 L.Ed. 145, 150 , 2 and what was said in the Bruce's Juices case, without further word from the Supreme Court, we would be extremely hesitant to hold that a valid judgment for treble damages could not be had for violations of 13a.
Reversed.
