 MURPHY , Circuit Judge.
This case involves the tax status of land within an Indian reservation which was once alienated from Indian ownership and subsequently reacquired by the tribe in fee simple.
In 1993 Cass County, Minnesota levied an ad valorem tax on such fee land owned by the Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians.
The Band paid the taxes under protest and sought a declaratory judgment that the land is immune from state taxation, an injunction ending the taxation, and an order refunding the taxes already paid.
Based on its interpretation of County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakima Indian Nation , 502 U.S. 251 , 112 S.Ct. 683 , 116 L.Ed.2d 687 (1992), the district court granted summary judgment for Cass County.
The Band appeals.
We affirm in part and reverse in part.
I. The Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians is a federally recognized Indian tribe, whose reservation is located in northern Minnesota.
The reservation was created by a series of treaties with the United States government, beginning in 1855 and ending with an executive order in 1874.
See, e.g. , Treaty with the Chippewas , Feb. 22, 1855, 10 Stat. 1165 (1855); Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians v. Herbst , 334 F.Supp.
1001, 1002 (D.Minn.1971).
Although the pattern of land ownership within the reservation has varied over the years, the reservation has never been disestablished or diminished.
See Herbst , 334 F.Supp.
at 1002 (D.Minn.1971) (involving hunting and fishing rights); State v. Forge , 262 N.W.2d 341, 343-44 (Minn.1977) (same).
The Band's original reservation was impacted by changes in federal Indian policy.
During the latter part of the nineteenth century, the United States adopted an allotment policy in order to break up reservations previously established by treaty.
This policy granted allotments of land to individual tribal members and sold the often sizable remainder of reservation land to non-Indians.
See Felix S. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 127-38 (1982).
The purpose of the policy was to open land to non-Indians and to assimilate the Indian people into the broader American society.
Id. at 128.
The overall effect was drastically to reduce the amount of land under Indian control.
Id. at 138.
The legislative centerpiece of the allotment policy was the General Allotment Act (GAA), ch.
119, 24 Stat. 338 (1887), (codified as amended in scattered sections of 25 U.S.C.) (sometimes referred to as the Dawes Act).
Under the GAA, parcels of land to be granted to individual Indians were initially held in trust by the United States.
Section 5 of the GAA provided that after a twenty-five year trust period, the United States would convey the land in fee simple to the individual allottee.
1 During the trust period the allottees were not permitted to convey the land.
Section 6 of the GAA provided that the allottees would be subject to state civil and criminal law.
In 1906 Congress amended the GAA by the Burke Act, ch.
2348, 34 Stat. 182 (1906).
The Burke Act amended 6 of the GAA to make clear that allottees would be subject to state law only after the expiration of the trust period and issuance of a patent in fee simple.
2 Yakima , 502 U.S. at 264 , 112 S.Ct. at 691 .
The Burke Act contained a proviso which enabled the Secretary of the Interior to issue a fee simple patent before the expiration of the twenty-five year trust period to "competent and capable" allottees.
Burke Act, ch.
2348, 34 Stat. 182 (1906).
The proviso stated that land allotted under the GAA would be free from restrictions on "sale, incumbrance, or taxation" when a patent was issued in fee.
Id.; see Yakima , 502 U.S. at 264 n. 4, 112 S.Ct. at 691 n. 4.
For the Leech Lake Band and other Minnesota Chippewa tribes, the allotment policy was carried out through the Nelson Act of 1889, ch.
24, 25 Stat. 642 (1889), which partially incorporated the GAA.
The Nelson Act created a commission to negotiate with the Band for the "cession and relinquishment" of its reservation land.
Id. The Leech Lake Band agreed in 1889 to have land disbursed under the Nelson Act and the agreement went into effect in 1890.
The details of the negotiations with the Leech Lake Band are unclear, but there is some evidence that representatives of the United States told other Minnesota Chippewa tribes that the land allotted to the individual tribal members would not be taxed.
During the negotiations a member of the White Earth Band of Chippewa Indians asked the United States' lead negotiator, Harry M. Rice, this question: "I should like to ask whether, when the Dawes bill 3 refers to the civil and criminal laws, those provisions apply so as to make our people here subject to the taxation of the white man?"
Mr.
Rice responded: "I think you will come within the same rule as officers at the United States forts; their property is not taxed."
The Chippewa Indians in Minnesota , H.R.
Ex. Doc.
No. 247, at 93 (1890).
Individuals from other tribes were present during this colloquy.
Id. Cases involving other bands and other legislation have suggested that the land might only be free from taxation during the original trust period, however.
Mahnomen County, Minn. v. United States , 319 U.S. 474, 480 , 63 S.Ct. 1254, 1258 , 87 L.Ed. 1527 (1943) (Murphy, J., dissenting) (land allotted to Mahnomen County Band of Chippewa Indians under Clapp Act exempt from taxation for twenty-five years); United States v. Spaeth , 24 F.Supp.
465, 469 (D.Minn.1938) (land allotted to a White Earth Chippewa Indian under Clapp Act exempt from taxation for twenty-five years).
The Nelson Act disposed of reservation land in three ways.
The allotment of land to individual Indians under 3 of the Nelson Act was done in conformity with the GAA, and Leech Lake tribal members were allotted land either within the Leech Lake reservation or within the reservation of the White Earth Band of Chippewa Indians, which is also in northern Minnesota.
The rest of the land was made available to the general public.
Some was sold under 4 and 5, the pine lands provisions, and the rest was sold under 6 pursuant to the Homestead Act, ch.
75, 12 Stat. 392 (1862).
Federal Indian policy changed substantially once again in 1934 with the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA), ch.
576, 48 Stat. 984 (1934) (codified as amended at 25 U.S.C. 461-479 (1996)).
The IRA reestablished federal recognition of Indian tribes, and while it did not repeal allotment statutes such as the Nelson Act, it ended the allotment policy and sought to reverse the erosion of the tribal land base by extending indefinitely the trust period for all land held by the United States in trust for Indian tribes.
25 U.S.C. 461-462.
The Band is governed in part by a constitution adopted by the Minnesota Chippewa Tribes pursuant to the IRA.
See 476.
The Leech Lake Band managed to preserve its tribal identity despite the federal allotment policy and has maintained a continuing presence on its reservation land.
During the allotment period over three quarters of the tribal members who were allotted land remained within the Leech Lake reservation boundaries.
4 Folwell, History of Minnesota 235 (1930).
Nonetheless, by 1977 the Band and individual tribal members owned only 27,000 acres, or less than five percent of the reservation land.
See Forge , 262 N.W.2d at 343 & n. 1 (Minn.1977).
In an effort to rebuild what was lost through the allotment policy, the Band began slowly to recover its land base.
The land in question in this case consists of twenty-one parcels within the boundaries of the reservation.
The legal description of each parcel is found in paragraph ten of the Band's complaint.
This land was once held in trust for the Band by the United States according to terms of their treaties, but was later alienated from tribal control under provisions of the Nelson Act.
Thirteen of the parcels were allotted to individual Indians under 3 of the Act; seven parcels were sold as pine lands under 4 and 5 for commercial timber harvest by non-Indians; and one parcel was distributed under 6 as a homestead plot to a non-Indian.
Subsequently, all parcels came to be held by non-Indians, but the Band reacquired each parcel in fee between 1980 and 1992.
Cass County did not impose its ad valorem tax on these parcels until 1993, one year after the Supreme Court issued its Yakima decision.
The Court had held in Yakima that Indian lands originally allotted under the GAA were subject to certain types of state taxation.
502 U.S. at 270 , 112 S.Ct. at 694 .
It found that the language of 6 of the GAA supported an ad valorem tax on such land, but not an excise tax on its sale.
Id. at 266-70 , 112 S.Ct. at 692-94 .
The Band initially declined to pay the taxes levied by Cass County, but eventually paid under protest in order to avoid foreclosure.
By July 1, 1995 it had paid a total of over $64,000 in taxes.
In June 1995, the Band filed suit in federal court seeking a declaratory judgment that the lands are not taxable by the County.
The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Cass County, holding that all land alienated from tribal control under the Nelson Act was taxable.
Leech Lake Band of Chippewa Indians v. Cass County , 908 F.Supp.
689 (D.Minn.1995).
The court interpreted Yakima to mean that land held by Indian tribes is taxable by the state if it is freely alienable and dismissed the Band's case. 4 II.
On appeal the Band contends that Yakima can be distinguished from the present case both factually and legally.
The Band asserts that Yakima was concerned primarily with fee land owned by individual tribal members rather than the tribe itself.
The principle of tribal sovereignty can defeat state taxation here it says.
Yakima cannot be so easily distinguished, however.
The land involved in that case was held both by individual Indians and the tribe itself.
502 U.S. at 256, 270 , 112 S.Ct. at 687, 694 .
Although tribal sovereignty can be an impediment to the exercise of state jurisdiction over Indians and their property, see, e.g. , Montana v. United States , 450 U.S. 544, 565-66 , 101 S.Ct. 1245, 1258-59 , 67 L.Ed.2d 493 (1981), considerations of inherent sovereignty may not prevent certain forms of taxation.
Yakima , 502 U.S. at 257 , 112 S.Ct. at 687 (noting that "platonic notions of Indian sovereignty have, over time, lost their independent sway."
(citations omitted)(internal quotations omitted)).
In Yakima , the county had imposed an ad valorem tax on all real property and an excise tax on the sale of such property.
5 It believed that these taxes applied to all land within the county, even land patented in fee under the GAA and owned by the Yakima Indian Nation or individual tribal members within the reservation boundaries.
When the county threatened to foreclose on certain parcels for which taxes had not been paid, the tribe brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief.
The Supreme Court held that the GAA authorized the ad valorem tax levied by Yakima County, but not the excise tax.
502 U.S. at 270 , 112 S.Ct. at 694 .
The ad valorem tax was acceptable because the Burke Act proviso permitted the "taxation of land," and this was sufficient to overcome the Court's per se rule against state taxation of Indians or their land.
Id. at 267-68 , 112 S.Ct. at 692-93 .
The language of the proviso was not sufficient to indicate Congress had authorized an excise tax on the sale of such land, however.
Id. at 268-69 , 112 S.Ct. at 693-94 .
The meaning of Yakima as precedent is crucial to the outcome of the case before this court.
The Band argues that Yakima is consistent with many other cases requiring an "unmistakably clear" congressional intent to allow any form of state taxation.
According to the Band, the Court found unmistakably clear congressional intent for the ad valorem tax by examining the text and effect of both 5 and 6 of the GAA.
6 Section 5 made the land to be transferred alienable, a necessary precondition to state taxation of Indian lands.
It was 6, however, as amended by the Burke Act proviso, that provided the unmistakably clear intent to allow such taxes.
The Band points out that this is the reading of Yakima adopted in Southern Ute Indian Tribe v. Board of County Comm'rs , 855 F.Supp.
1194 (D.Colo.
1994), vacated , 61 F.3d 916 (10th Cir.1995) (on ripeness grounds).
Southern Ute read Yakima to mean that the alienability established in 5 "was not an independent justification for taxation," but rather an implication of taxability, while the specific language of 6, as amended by the Burke Act proviso provided the "unmistakably clear" congressional intent to allow such taxation.
Southern Ute , 855 F.Supp.
at 1200 .
Cass County, on the other hand, argues that Yakima stands for the proposition that if Indian lands are made alienable in any way, they are taxable by the state.
Section 5 of the GAA, making allotments alienable, is seen as the key to the validity of the ad valorem tax in Yakima .
The County finds support in two cases which have interpreted Yakima to mean "alienability equals taxability."
Lummi Indian Tribe v. Whatcom County, Wash. , 5 F.3d 1355 (9th Cir.1993), cert. denied , 512 U.S. 1228 , 114 S.Ct. 2727 , 129 L.Ed.2d 850 (1994); United States on Behalf of Saginaw Chippewa Tribe v. Michigan , 882 F.Supp.
659 (E.D.Mich.1995), rev'd , 106 F.3d 130 (6th Cir.1997).
Both Lummi and the district court in Saginaw seized on the relatively brief discussion of 5 in Yakima as evidence that an act of Congress can subject Indian lands to state taxation by doing nothing more than making them alienable.
Lummi , 5 F.3d at 1357-58 ; Saginaw , 882 F.Supp.
at 672 .
Subsequent to oral argument in this case the Sixth Circuit reversed the Saginaw district court.
United States on Behalf of Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe v. Michigan , 106 F.3d 130 (6th Cir.1997).
The Sixth Circuit concluded that Yakima was consistent with the general rule requiring unmistakable congressional intent to permit taxation of Indian land and that making land alienable does not in itself show the requisite intent.
It stated the Court's holding as follows: Yakima Saginaw , 106 F.3d 130, 133 , citing Yakima , 502 U.S. at 259 , 112 S.Ct. at 688-89 .
Despite the Sixth Circuit's thorough discussion of Yakima and earlier precedent on which the dissent relies in this case, the dissent mentions this decision only in passing.
The County's theory that alienability always equals taxability is unsatisfactory because it fails to consider the language and context of the entire Yakima opinion.
First, as the County concedes, its reading conflicts with the Yakima opinion itself and with Supreme Court precedent requiring Congress to provide unmistakably clear intent before allowing state taxation of Indians or their property.
See Yakima , 502 U.S. at 258 , 112 S.Ct. at 688 (citing Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe , 471 U.S. 759, 765 , 105 S.Ct. 2399, 2402-03 , 85 L.Ed.2d 753 (1985); California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians , 480 U.S. 202, 215 n. 17, 107 S.Ct. 1083, 1091 n. 17, 94 L.Ed.2d 244 (1987)).
Second, in order to support its argument, the County must read Yakima as resting its conclusion solely on the effect of the alienability section of the GAA.
This reading disregards the significance given by the Court to the language of 6 of the GAA.
It repeatedly pointed to the Burke Act proviso in 6 as the primary source of clear congressional intent to allow the ad valorem tax levied by Yakima County.
502 U.S. at 258-59 , 112 S.Ct. at 688-89 .
Third, the County's reading of Yakima also disregards the language and analysis in section III of the opinion.
In section III, the Court separately analyzed each type of tax at issue and concluded that the 6 Burke Act proviso authorized the ad valorem tax, but not the excise tax levied by Yakima County.
502 U.S. at 268 , 112 S.Ct. at 693 .
As the Sixth Circuit noted in Saginaw , Yakima Saginaw , 106 F.3d 130, 134 .
If alienability always equals taxability, it should be the nature of the property right, not the nature of the tax, that matters.
If that were the rule, the Court should have upheld both the ad valorem and the excise taxes levied by the County since the land was made alienable by the GAA.
Instead, the Court refused to uphold the excise tax because it found that the language of the Burke Act proviso could not justify the imposition of such a tax.
Id. at 268-70 , 112 S.Ct. at 693-94 .
Under the County's reading of Yakima , section III of the opinion would be superfluous and the Court would have reached a different result.
Finally, if alienability were equivalent to taxability, it is difficult to explain the terms of the remand in Yakima .
That remand left open the question of whether land allotted under a different act might be taxed or not.
7 If alienability equaled taxability it should not have mattered under which act the land was made alienable--the mere fact of alienability should have been enough to allow state taxation.
To determine if a state may tax Indians or their property, the Supreme Court has consistently asked whether Congress has made its intent to allow state taxation unmistakably clear.
The Court in Yakima stated the rule strongly: McCulloch v. Maryland 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.)
316, 431 4 L.Ed. 579 Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones 411 U.S. 145, 148 93 S.Ct. 1267, 1270 36 L.Ed.2d 114 Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe 471 U.S. 759, 765 105 S.Ct. 2399, 2403 85 L.Ed.2d 753 see also California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians 480 U.S. 202, 215 107 S.Ct. 1083, 1091 94 L.Ed.2d 244 502 U.S. at 258 , 112 S.Ct. at 688 .
Both sides in the case also framed the proper inquiry as whether the GAA evinced an unmistakably clear congressional intent to permit state taxation.
Id. at 258-60 , 112 S.Ct. at 688-89 .
Yakima inquired whether Congress had made its intent to allow state taxation unmistakably clear and found that Congress had for the ad valorem tax, but not for the excise tax.
Id. 8 The Burke Act amendment to 6 of the GAA was identified after inquiry as the main source of the unmistakably clear congressional intent to allow the state ad valorem tax.
For example, in the third paragraph of section II, the Court states: as amended Congress in the Burke Act proviso "manifest[ed] a clear intention to permit the state to tax" such Indian lands 502 U.S. at 258-59 , 112 S.Ct. at 688 .
The Burke Act proviso was also seen as the main source of statutory ambiguity where the state excise tax levied by Yakima County was concerned.
"While the Burke Act proviso does not purport to describe the entire range of in rem jurisdiction States may exercise with respect to fee-patented reservation land, we think it does describe the entire range of jurisdiction to tax ."
Id. at 268 , 112 S.Ct. at 693 (emphasis added).
The Court concluded that the language of the proviso did not clearly permit a state excise tax, noting that "the short of the matter is that the General Allotment Act explicitly authorizes only 'taxation of land,' not 'taxation with respect to land,' 'taxation of transactions involving land,' or 'taxation based on the value of land.'"
Id. at 269 , 112 S.Ct. at 694 .
"It is quite reasonable to say, in other words, that though the object of the sale here is land, that does not make land the object of the tax , and hence does not invoke the Burke Act proviso [which only authorizes the 'taxation of land']."
Id. at 268-69 , 112 S.Ct. at 693 .
The County counters by pointing to one particular sentence for the strongest evidence that Yakima should be read to mean alienability equals taxability.
The dissent also describes this sentence as the specific holding of Yakima .
The sentence states: "Thus, when 5 rendered the allotted lands alienable and encumberable, it also rendered them subject to assessment and forced sale for taxes."
Id. at 263-64 , 112 S.Ct. at 691 .
As the Sixth Circuit points out, however: Yakima this statement was merely part of an explanation of the structure of the General Allotment Act Saginaw , 106 F.3d 130, 132 (citations omitted) (internal quotation omitted) (emphasis added).
In the very next sentence to the one relied on by the County, the Court noted that "the Burke Act proviso, enacted in 1906, made this implication of 5 explicit, and its nature more clear."
Id. at 264 , 112 S.Ct. at 691 .
The import of this latter sentence is that 5 only implied taxability.
This reading is confirmed four sentences later when the Court states that the Burke Act proviso "reaffirmed for such 'prematurely' patented lands what 5 of the General Allottment Act implied with respect to patented land generally: subjection to state real estate taxes."
Id. The Yakima Court thus understood 5 to be only an implication of taxability, and 6, as amended by the Burke Act proviso, was needed to show the necessary clear intent to tax.
No court has taken the position that an implication alone is sufficient to provide unmistakably clear congressional intent to allow state taxation, and Yakima found an unmistakably clear congressional intent to allow state taxation on land by relying on both the language and effect of 5 and 6, as amended, of the GAA.
Without alienability there would be no taxability, but it does not follow that alienability alone is sufficient to provide the requisite unmistakable intent.
Something like the language of the Burke Act proviso in 6 is needed to find unmistakably clear intent to allow state taxation.
Id. at 259 , 112 S.Ct. at 688-89 .
The history of the Burke Act also demonstrates that 6, as amended, is the source of the necessary clear intent to allow state taxation of land (but not its sale).
The proviso was passed in reaction to the Supreme Court's decision in In re Heff , 197 U.S. 488 , 25 S.Ct. 506 , 49 L.Ed. 848 (1905), which held that 6 of the GAA subjected an Indian allottee to the personal jurisdiction of the state the moment the allotment in trust was made.
Yakima , 502 U.S. at 264 , 112 S.Ct. at 691 .
Since the land was still being held in trust by the United States, it was presumably not taxable by a state even though personal jurisdiction existed over the titular owner of the land. 9 Heff , 197 U.S. at 509 , 25 S.Ct. at 512 (distinguishing personal jurisdiction from jurisdiction over the land).
In re Heff thus created a situation where the state could have jurisdiction over the Indian allottee, but not over his or her land.
The purpose of the Burke Act legislation was, at least in part, to clarify the post Heff reach of state jurisdiction over Indians receiving allotments.
Yakima , 502 U.S. at 264 , 112 S.Ct. at 691 .
The Burke Act amendment accomplished two things.
First, it changed the point at which state law would apply to an allottee Indian from the time when a trust patent was first issued to the time when a patent was issued in fee.
Id. Second, it made clear that an allottee could be subject to taxation upon issuance of a fee patent.
Id. at 259 , 112 S.Ct. at 688-89 .
The Burke Act proviso to 6 of the GAA is thus the primary source of the requisite clear congressional intent to allow state ad valorem taxes on Indian lands.
The Yakima Court discussed 5 and alienability in a single paragraph of section II of its opinion.
That paragraph addressed the relevance of Goudy v. Meath , 203 U.S. 146 , 27 S.Ct. 48 , 51 L.Ed. 130 (1906), to the arguments of the Yakima Nation and the United States as amicus.
10 Goudy had held that an Indian allottee could be personally liable for delinquent real estate taxes on fee land allotted under the GAA.
The Goudy Court found liability for two reasons.
First, the Court noted that it would be strange for Congress to remove restrictions on alienation of the land and not subject it to taxation.
Id. at 149 , 27 S.Ct. at 50 .
Second, the Court found that the language of 6 extended the laws of the state or territory to the Indian allottee, including the state tax laws.
Id. at 149-50 , 27 S.Ct. at 50 .
Yakima characterized the Goudy decision as one in which alienation was of central significance to the finding of liability.
502 U.S. at 263 , 112 S.Ct. at 690-91 .
The Court never suggested that Goudy relied exclusively on the alienability of the land.
Instead, the Goudy decision premised liability on both the alienability of the land and the specific language of 6 of the GAA.
Goudy , 203 U.S. at 149-50 , 27 S.Ct. at 50 .
Goudy is therefore analogous to Yakima where the Court relied on both the express language of 6, as amended by the Burke Act proviso, 11 and the 5 alienability of the land, which created the necessary conditions for taxation.
In sum, the County's reading of Yakima conflicts with other language in the opinion itself, and with strong Supreme Court precedent espousing an unmistakably clear congressional intent rule.
While the Court considered alienability as one factor contributing to the taxability of the land, alienability alone was not sufficient to allow state taxation.
The express language of the Burke Act proviso in 6 of the GAA was needed to make sufficiently clear the intent of Congress to allow state ad valorem taxes.
III.
The parcels of land involved in this case were alienated from tribal control by the Nelson Act and subsequently reacquired by the Band in fee.
State taxation of Indian land is not authorized unless Congress "has made its intention to do so unmistakably clear."
Yakima, at 258 , 112 S.Ct. at 688 , quoting Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe , 471 U.S. at 765 , 105 S.Ct. at 2402-03 .
The question in this case is whether the Nelson Act evinces an "unmistakably clear" congressional intent to allow an ad valorem tax on these parcels.
Eight of the 21 lots were sold as pine lands or distributed as homestead lands under 4, 5, or 6 of the Nelson Act.
These sections of the Act, unlike 3, did not incorporate the GAA or include any mention of an intent to tax lands distributed under them which might become reacquired by the Band in fee.
These parcels are therefore not subject to state taxation.
Section 3 of the Nelson Act allotted certain lands on the Leech Lake reservation by incorporating the mechanisms of the GAA.
The Band argues that the GAA itself does not evince an unmistakably clear intent to allow ad valorem taxes on tribally held land because 5 and 6 of the GAA only address the allotment of land to individual Indians, but that argument cannot be reconciled Yakima .
Yakima held 12 that after the addition of the Burke Act proviso, lands allotted under the GAA are subject to state ad valorem taxes when they are patented in fee.
502 U.S. at 266-70 , 112 S.Ct. at 692-94 .
This is true for both lands allotted to individual Indians and lands subsequently reacquired by a tribe.
See id. at 256, 270 , 112 S.Ct. at 687, 694 .
For these reasons the land which passed under 3 of the Nelson Act is taxable if it was patented after the passage of the Burke Act proviso in 1906, but not if it were patented before then.
13 In sum, the judgment in favor of the County is vacated.
The district court is affirmed in its determination that the County may apply its ad valorem tax to land allotted under 3 of the Nelson Act, unless any parcel is shown to have been patented in fee before the passage of the Burke Act.
The judgment is reversed as to the parcels which passed under the pine lands or homestead sections of the Act and the case is remanded for consideration of that portion of the Band's claim for refunds which is still relevant and for any necessary proceedings consistent with this opinion.
