 EAST , Senior District Judge.
THE APPEAL The plaintiff-appellant Benno P. Ludwig, as Administrator of the Estate of Dean E. Cane, deceased, (hereinafter for convenience referred to as Cane) appeals from an adverse summary judgment denying his claim for double the amount of accidental death benefits under a life insurance policy (policy) issued by the defendant-appellee Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (hereinafter for convenience referred to as Insurer).
We reverse and remand.
FACTS The undisputed facts are: Cane then a resident of the state of Michigan and within that state applied to the Insurer for the policy on August 27, 1970, which policy was finally made, delivered, and became effective within Michigan on October 27, 1970.
Thereafter and prior to July 26, 1972, Cane changed his residence to the state of Illinois and on that date made a change of beneficiary under the policy to his estate.
On the following August 2, while still a resident of Illinois and while the policy was in force and effect, Cane purchased a Burlington Northern Railroad commuter passenger ticket from Lisle, Illinois to Chicago, Illinois.
He entered the railroad station in Lisle with the intention of boarding the appropriate train.
As he attempted to cross the tracks to reach the proper boarding location for his eastbound commuter train, he was struck and killed by a westbound mail freight train proceeding through the station area.
The commuter train had not yet arrived in the station at the time of the accident.
The Insurer had paid the estate the ordinary death benefits as provided in the policy and an additional $20,000 accidental death benefits, but had denied further liability for double benefits as provided in the accidental death benefit agreement provisions of the policy (hereinafter for convenience referred to as accidental provision).
The accidental provision in its pertinent parts reads:
