 ELY , Circuit Judge: Naughten is an Oregon state prisoner, convicted of the offense of armed robbery.
His direct appeal in the Oregon state courts was unsuccessful.
State v. Naughten , 90 Adv.Or.
1811 , 471 P.2d 830 (App. 1970).
Eventually, Naughten filed a petition for habeas corpus in the court below, and he now appeals from the denial of that petition.
In the state court trial, the judge, over Naughten's objection, 1 instructed the jury as follows: Such an instruction has been almost universally condemned.
See United States v. Birmingham , 447 F.2d 1313 (10th Cir. 1971) ; United States v. Stroble , 431 F.2d 1273 (6th Cir. 1970) ; McMillen v. United States , 386 F.2d 29 (1st Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 1031 , 88 S.Ct. 1424 , 20 L.Ed.2d 288 ; United States v. Dichiarinte , 385 F.2d 333 (7th Cir. 1967) ; United States v. Johnson , 371 F.2d 800 (3d Cir. 1967) ; United States v. Persico , 349 F.2d 6 (2d Cir. 1965).
See also United States v. Safley , 408 F.2d 603 (4th Cir. 1969); Harrison v. United States , 387 F.2d 614 (5th Cir. 1968); Stone v. United States , 126 U.S.App.D.C.
369 , 379 F.2d 146 (1967).
In Stone v. United States , supra , Judge, now Chief Justice, Burger, wrote: 379 F.2d at 147 .
In the state court trial, Naughten did not testify, nor did he present any witnesses in his defense.
Thus, the clear effect of the challenged instruction was to place the burden on Naughten to prove his innocence.
This is so repugnant to the American concept that it is offensive to any fair notion of due process of law.
See Bentley v. Crist , 469 F.2d 854, 855 n. 2 (9th Cir. 1972).
The appellee contends that other of the court's instructions offset the vice of the instruction that we have quoted.
We do not agree, for there was no instruction so specifically directed to that under attack as can be said to have effected a cure.
The appelleee also contends that the instruction, even if fatally defective under the federal constitution, was, in the circumstances, harmless beyond all reasonable doubt.
Chapman v. California , 386 U.S. 18 , 87 S.Ct. 824 , 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).
We reject this argument also.
Once Naughten established the infringement of a constitutionally protected right, the burden shifted to the appellee to establish that the error was harmless under the Chapman standard.
From our examination of the transcript of the trial proceedings, we conclude that the appellee could not, in this case, meet the burden.
Cf. Anderson v. Nelson , 390 U.S. 523 , 88 S.Ct. 1133 , 20 L.Ed.2d 81 (1968).
Naughten is entitled to a new trial; therefore, upon remand, the District Court will hold the petition in abeyance for a reasonable period, not to exceed sixty days, so as to afford Oregon the opportunity to reprosecute Naughten should it choose to do so.
Reversed and remanded.
