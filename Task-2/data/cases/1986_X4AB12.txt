 BOYCE F. MARTIN, Jr.
, Circuit Judge.
This appeal challenges the constitutionality of two ordinances of the City of Newport, Kentucky.
Ordinance 0-82-85 prohibits nude or nearly nude dancing in establishments selling liquor by the drink, and provides for both criminal and civil sanctions.
The second ordinance, 0-82-56, requires certain employees of such establishments to register with the Newport police department, to be fingerprinted, photographed, and to procure an identification card.
The appellants are managing agents of retail liquor establishments which provide live entertainment including nude and nearly nude dancing.
They claim that the ordinances deprive them of their constitutional rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. 1983 , and seek a declaratory judgment and permanent injunctive relief against enforcement of the ordinances.
The fingerprinting ordinance, 0-82-56, provides in pertinent part: 1 Later sections exempt persons whose "primary function is the service of food."
The penalty for violation of this ordinance is a fine of not less than twenty-five nor more than five hundred dollars, which can be assessed against both the employee and employer.
The proprietors in this case claim that the fingerprinting ordinance infringes upon their rights under the first, ninth, and fourteenth amendments.
They contend that their right of privacy and right of association are specifically threatened by this enactment, citing Griswold v. Connecticut , 381 U.S. 479 , 85 S.Ct. 1678 , 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965).
We do not believe that any fundamental constitutional rights are implicated by this ordinance.
Because the ordinance bears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest, we view it as a proper exercise of the City's police power.
People v. Stuller , 10 Cal.App.3d 582 , 89 Cal.Rptr.
158 (1970), cert. denied , 401 U.S. 977 , 91 S.Ct. 1205 , 28 L.Ed.2d 327 (1971); Sibert v. Dep't of Alcoholic Beverage Control , 169 Cal.App.2d 563 , 337 P.2d 882 (1959); Friedman v. Valentine , 177 Misc.
437 , 30 N.Y.S.2d 891 (Sup.Ct.1941), aff'd , 266 A.D. 561 , 42 N.Y.S.2d 593 (1943).
Newport's fingerprinting ordinance does not contain a statement of its purpose.
The district judge discussed Newport's "tarnished image" and concluded that correcting this image constituted a rational basis for the ordinance.
The City asserts that the ordinance would facilitate enforcement of various state laws regulating retail liquor establishments.
While a specific statement of the purpose of the ordinance should have been included in its text, fingerprints and photographs of those serving alcohol will clearly further compliance with the Kentucky statute prohibiting minors and convicted felons 2 from serving alcohol in any retail establishment, K. R.S.
244.090 .
Newport's notorious crime problems intensify the necessity of such compliance; a remand for a statement to this effect is therefore not required.
See, e.g. , Friedman v. Valentine , 30 N.Y.S.2d at 894 ("That an unsupervised cabaret offers a tempting field for abuses and crimes is almost axiomatic.")
Courts have consistently upheld the constitutionality of similar ordinances as valid implementations of the police power.
In People v. Stuller , 10 Cal.App.3d 582 , 89 Cal.Rptr.
158 (1970), cert. denied , 401 U.S. 977 , 91 S.Ct. 1205 , 28 L.Ed.2d 327 (1971), a bartender's fingerprints taken pursuant to a virtually identical ordinance were admitted as evidence in his trial for rape.
In rejecting the defendant's claim that the ordinance authorized an unconstitutional invasion of his privacy, the Stuller court noted the minimal nature of the intrusion involved in registration and fingerprinting, and listed the numerous non-criminal situations in which fingerprints are required.

at 166-67 .
A New York Police Commission regulation requiring the registration and fingerprinting of all cabaret employees was upheld in Friedman v. Valentine , 177 Misc.
437 , 30 N.Y.S.2d 891 (Sup.Ct.1941), aff'd , 266 A.D. 561 , 42 N.Y.S.2d 593 (1943).
The court held that the regulation was justified by conditions in the cabaret industry, stating "[n]o one can seriously argue against the conclusion that persons employed in cabarets and by their concessionnaires have especially favorable opportunities to victimize patrons of such establishments."
30 N.Y.S.2d at 895 .
Friedman was reaffirmed in Simone v. Kennedy , 26 Misc.2d 748 , 212 N.Y.S.2d 838, 840 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1961), in which the court approved the police department's practice of charging fees for the identification cards required by the ordinance.
The Friedman reasoning helped pave the way for a federal case on fingerprinting requirements, Thom v. N.Y.
Stock Exchange , 306 F.Supp.
1002 (S.D.N.Y.1969), aff'd sub nom.
Miller v. N.Y.
Stock Exchange , 425 F.2d 1074 (2d Cir.), cert. denied , 398 U.S. 905 , 90 S.Ct. 1696 , 26 L.Ed.2d 64 (1970).
Thom upheld the constitutionality of a New York state statute requiring fingerprinting of all employees of member firms of national security exchanges registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and all employees of affiliated cleaning corporations.
The court rejected the plaintiff's privacy argument, observing that fingerprinting "is only a means of verifying the required information as to the existence or nonexistence of a prior criminal record [t]he actual inconvenience is minor; the claimed indignity, nonexistent; detention, there is none; nor unlawful search; nor unlawful seizure."
Id. at 1009 .
See also id. at 1007 n. 17 (citing federal and state cases upholding fingerprinting requirements); Davis v. Mississippi , 394 U.S. 721, 727-28 , 89 S.Ct. 1394, 1397-98 , 22 L.Ed.2d 676 (1969) (recognizing the minimal intrusiveness of the fingerprinting process).
The Durham, North Carolina City Council adopted a similar, but more extensive, ordinance regulating massage parlors.
The ordinance requires all applicants for licenses for massage businesses to be fingerprinted and photographed, and to submit to medical examinations.
The constitutionality of this ordinance was upheld in Brown v. Brannon , 399 F.Supp.
133, 138-39 (M.D.N.C.1975), aff'd , 535 F.2d 1249 (4th Cir.1976).
The Brown court concluded that the ordinance was rationally related to a valid state interest: "[T]he photographing and fingerprinting obviously serve to aid police and administrative personnel in identifying and investigating potential applicants for a license The records also would aid in the efforts of North Carolina relating to offenses against public morality and decency."
Id. at 139 .
Fingerprints are required by states and cities in many noncriminal situations, most often in connection with applications for licenses or permits.
See, e.g. , Ky., Sup.Ct.R.
2.020(2) (requiring fingerprints of applicants for the bar); Louisville, Ky., Code 73.22, 112.15(2) (requiring photographs and fingerprints of applicants for licenses for numerous occupations, including auctioneers, fortune tellers, and collecting agencies); Louisville, Ky., Code 114.049(A) (D) (requiring fingerprinting of all applicants for retail liquor licenses and authorizing the Director of Safety to require fingerprinting of all "stockholders, agents, or employees of a licensed corporation" if he has reasonable grounds to believe the person has a prior criminal record.)
Newport's fingerprinting ordinance serves corresponding goals.
Because no fundamental right is threatened by the ordinance, it will be upheld if it is reasonable, not arbitrary, and bears a rational relationship to a permissible state objective.
Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas , 416 U.S. 1 , 94 S.Ct. 1536 , 39 L.Ed.2d 797 (1974).
We believe that the ordinance legitimately furthers Kentucky's objective of screening employees of retail liquor establishments, and advances the city's goal of eliminating crime.

International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness v. City of Houston , 689 F.2d 541, 556-57 (5th Cir.1982) (upholding city ordinance requiring religious solicitors to comply with registration and financial disclosure requirements, and to carry identification cards); Hamilton v. New Jersey Real Estate Comm'n.
, 117 N.J.Super.
345 , 284 A.2d 564 (1971) (upholding Real Estate Commission regulation requiring all applicants for salesman, broker-salesman, or broker's licenses to be fingerprinted); Playboy Club of New York, Inc. v. O'Connell , 18 A.D.2d 339 , 239 N.Y.S.2d 262 (1963), aff'd , 14 N.Y.2d 503 , 248 N.Y.S.2d 226 , 197 N.E.2d 662 (1964) (upholding regulation of department of licenses that female cabaret employees are prohibited from mingling with patrons).
Compare Wulp v. Corcoran , 454 F.2d 826, 834 (1st Cir.1972) (ordinance requiring newspaper vendors to obtain a license and to wear a badge held unconstitutional because printed materials distributed anonymously "have played an important role in the progress of mankind".
); Strasser v. Doorley , 432 F.2d 567 (1st Cir.1970) (same).
Wulp and Strasser involved undisputed first amendment concerns; no comparable governmental interest is threatened by this ordinance.
Judicial authority is therefore in agreement that requiring fingerprints of employees of retail liquor establishments bears a rational relationship to the legitimate goal of crime prevention.
The operators of the Newport establishments present essentially the same arguments rejected in these earlier cases.
Whatever the outer limits of the right to privacy, clearly it cannot be extended to apply to a procedure the Supreme Court regards as only minimally intrusive.
Enhanced protection has been held to apply only to such fundamental decisions as contraception, Griswold v. Connecticut , 381 U.S. 479 , 85 S.Ct. 1678 , 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965), and family living arrangements, Moore v. City of East Cleveland , 431 U.S. 494 , 97 S.Ct. 1932 , 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977).
Fingerprints and photographs have not been held to merit the same level of constitutional concern.
We also reject the proprietors' argument that the fingerprinting ordinance interferes with their freedom to pursue the occupation of their choice.
Although government may not unreasonably interfere with a citizen's pursuit of his occupation, Wilkerson v. Johnson , 699 F.2d 325, 327-28 (6th Cir.1983), this fingerprinting ordinance places no categorical restrictions on those who may be employed in retail liquor establishments.
Compliance with the ordinance is not a sufficiently serious impediment to the pursuit of employment in a retail liquor establishment to merit constitutional protection.
Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong , 426 U.S. 88 , 96 S.Ct. 1895 , 48 L.Ed.2d 495 (1976) (invalidating a civil service rule barring all non-citizens from employment in the federal civil service system).
We therefore reject the proprietors' claim, and affirm the lower court's ruling as to ordinance 0-82-56.
3 The challenge to Newport's nude dancing ordinance raises many different and complex legal issues.
After reviewing the arguments presented in the parties' briefs and at oral argument, this Court determined that the district court and the parties had proceeded on the basis that the case involved a conflict between the twenty-first amendment and other constitutional rights and therefore failed to discuss the questions of delegation, preemption, or the application of the Supreme Court's reasoning in New York State Liquor Auth. v. Bellanca , 452 U.S. 714 , 101 S.Ct. 2599 , 69 L.Ed.2d 357 (1981) to the facts of this case. The parties were therefore directed to file supplemental briefs on these issues.
Newport's nude dancing ordinance is almost identical to the New York State statute held constitutional in Bellanca .
The district court stated that the nude dancing ordinance is constitutional because it "is squarely within the doctrine of Bellanca ."
Because we do not agree that the doctrine of Bellanca applies in this case, we need not address the question of delegation of twenty-first amendment authority from the state to the city.
The rationale of the Bellanca decision is that, "[t]he State's power to ban the sale of alcoholic beverages entirely includes the lesser power to ban the sale of liquor on premises where topless dancing occurs."
Bellanca , 452 U.S. at 717 , 101 S.Ct. at 2601 .
Given the express statutory authorization for cities to conduct popular elections on the question of local prohibition, see K. R.S.
242.010-242.990 , as required by the Kentucky Constitution, 4 it is very doubtful that a city in Kentucky may by ordinance "ban the sale of alcoholic beverages entirely."
Therefore, even assuming that Kentucky has, in some metaphysical sense, delegated its twenty-first amendment power to the City of Newport, the ordinance does not fall within the Bellanca doctrine.
A city cannot exercise in part a power it does not hold in full, and the citizens of the city have not chosen to exercise the power granted to them by K. R.S.
242.010-242.990 and 61 of the Kentucky Constitution.
Because we believe that Bellanca's rationale does not apply to the facts of the instant case, we do not reach the state law question of delegation of authority from the state to the city.
This determination does not, however, dispose of the matter, because the city may still justify the ordinance as an appropriate exercise of its police power.
In Grand Faloon Tavern, Inc. v. Wicker , 670 F.2d 943, 944 (11th Cir.), cert. denied , 459 U.S. 859 , 103 S.Ct. 132 , 74 L.Ed.2d 113 (1982), the Eleventh Circuit observed: New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca 452 U.S. 714 101 S.Ct. 2599 69 L.Ed.2d 357 Bellanca See also Krueger v. City of Pensacola , 759 F.2d 851, 854-55 (11th Cir.1985) ("Because Florida has not delegated its regulatory authority to municipalities, however, Pensacola must justify its ordinance under the stricter standard typically used to review an infringement on a protected liberty interest justified solely under the government's police power.").
While the exact amount of proof necessary to satisfy this "stricter standard" is an issue properly left to the discretion of the district court, we note that no substantive evidence concerning the government's justifications for the ordinance was presented below.
We agree with the Eleventh Circuit that "[w]here such fundamental interests as free speech are at issue we require more than simply an articulation of some legitimate interest that the city could have had."
Krueger , 759 F.2d at 855 .
Specifically, no evidence was presented relating the crime rate in bars in which topless dancing occurs to the crime rate in bars lacking such entertainment.
The preamble to the ordinance, standing alone, is insufficient evidence of the motivating factors in its passage.
See Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim , 452 U.S. 61, 69-73 , 101 S.Ct. 2176, 2183-2185 , 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981); City of Miami Springs v.
J.J.T., Inc. , 437 So.2d 200, 204 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1983).
Of course, a municipality may not exercise its police power when local authority over the subject has been preempted by the state's exercise of its superior power to regulate the alcoholic beverage industry.
See, e.g. , City of Bowling Green v. Gasoline Marketers, Inc. , 539 S.W.2d 281, 284 (Ky.1976); City of Newport v. Tye , 335 S.W.2d 340, 342 (Ky.1960); Commonwealth ex. rel.
City of Hazard v. Day , 287 Ky. 176 , 152 S.W.2d 597 (1941); Die Burg, Inc. v. Underhill , 465 F.Supp.
1176, 1178 (M.D.Fla.1979).
We express no view as to the resolution of this difficult issue, which was not raised below, but merely note that it must be addressed if the lower court, after hearing all the evidence, determines that the ordinance is an appropriate exercise of the city's police power.
Another issue which would arise upon such a determination is the susceptibility of the language "or simulation thereof" to an attack on vagueness grounds.
Like the preemption issue, the vagueness challenge need not be addressed until a ruling on the City's police power authority is made by the court below.
Clearly, however, the Bellanca decision is not dispositive on the issue, because a vagueness claim was not raised before the Supreme Court in that case.
We hold further that the ordinance does not constitute an impermissible prior restraint upon either present or future restricted expression.
The appellants' argument that their zoning status would be altered if their occupational licenses were revoked does not constitute a reason to invalidate the ordinance as a prior restraint.
In this case, prescreening discretion is not vested in any administrative body, as in Near v. Minnesota , 283 U.S. 697 , 51 S.Ct. 625 , 75 L.Ed. 1357 (1931), and the dangers of censorship are not present.
A comparison of the dangers involved in systems of prior and subsequent restraint is contained in In re Halkin , 598 F.2d 176 (D.C.Cir.1979): Id. at 184 In summary, we hold only that the district court's determination that Newport's ordinance "falls squarely within the doctrine of Bellanca ," cannot stand.
We remand for a determination of the city's authority under the police power, and, if necessary, analysis of the preemption and vagueness issues.
We affirm as to the fingerprinting ordinance.
