 DANAHER , Circuit Judge.
Cammer appeals from an order adjudging him guilty of criminal contempt.
The essential facts are that Cammer is attorney of record for one Gold; on August 28, 1953, an indictment was returned against Gold by the May 1953 grand jury; the grand jury after Gold's indictment subpoenaed other persons represented by Cammer; on September 22, 1953, Cammer appeared in the District Court on behalf of these other persons and moved to quash and vacate the subpoenas served upon them; on this same day and the day following, September 22 and 23, 1953, Cammer sent identical letters and questionnaires to some fifteen members of the grand jury who were federal employees, and in so doing, Cammer acted without the permission or knowledge of the District Court.
The questionnaires related in general to the effect of the government's loyalty program on the grand jurors.
The letter accompanying the questionnaire stated that it was being submitted "in the interest of the fair administration of criminal justice" and urged that it was the recipient's "duty as a citizen to help enlighten the court on an issue which affects the liberty of a citizen on trial in a criminal case." The trial judge found that the questionnaires harassed the jurors and impinged upon their freedom of thought and decision.
He described Cammer's action as "intolerable" but concluded that a fine of $100 would be sufficient punishment since there was some doubt as to whether Cammer's acts "were committed in conscious wrong."
Cammer's contempt was adjudged specifically under 401 of the Federal Contempt Statute, 18 U.S.C. 401 (1952), 1 [**32] which provides as follows: "A court of the United States shall have power to punish by fine or imprisonment, at its discretion, such contempt of its authority, and none others, as- "(1) Misbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice; "(2) Misbehavior of any of its officers in their official transactions; "(3) Disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command."
The government's application for an order to show cause was predicated upon acts and conduct said to constitute a violation of subsection (2) of the foregoing section.
Although appellant set up certain defenses which will not be detailed, his answer admitted all allegations of the government's petition except the following: The power of Congress to legislate with respect to the contempt powers of the federal courts other than the Supreme Court, is not open to question.
"These courts were created by acts of Congress.
Their powers and duties depend upon the act calling them into existence, or subsequent acts extending or limiting their jurisdiction.
The act of 1831 is, therefore, to them the law specifying the cases in which summary punishment for contempts may be inflicted."
Ex parte Robinson , 1873, 19 Wall. 505, 510-511 , 22 L.Ed. 205 .
The contempt statute has been described as an attempt by Congress "drastically" to limit the contempt powers of the courts.
In re Michael , 1945, 326 U.S. 224, 227 , 66 S.Ct. 78 , 90 L.Ed. 30 ; Nye v. United States , 1941, 313 U.S. 33, 44-48 , 61 S.Ct. 810 .
The Michael and Nye cases emphasize, however, that the main concern of Congress and the Supreme Court is not to protect contemptuous conduct, but to prevent abuses which may result from summary punishment.
Under the terms of 18 U.S.C. 401(2), we inquire whether: (1) Cammer was an officer of the court, (2) engaged in an official transaction, (3) whose conduct constituted misbehavior.
For the reasons which follow, the majority answers these questions affirmatively, though with great respect for the contrary views of our colleague.
1.
Cammer was an officer of the court .
It seems clear that attorneys are officers of the court within the intendment of the statute.
In Ex parte Garland , 1866, 4 Wall. 333, 378 , 18 L.Ed. 366 , Justice Field said: "[Attorneys] are officers of the court, admitted as such by its order, upon evidence of their possessing sufficient legal learning and fair private character.
.
.
.
The order of admission is the judgment of the court that the parties possess the requisite qualifications as attorneys and counsellors, and are entitled to appear as such and conduct causes therein.
From its entry the parties become officers of the court, and are responsible to it for professional misconduct.
They hold their office during good behavior, and can only be deprived of it for misconduct ascertained and declared by the judgment of the court after opportunity to be heard has been afforded."

United States , 10 Cir., 1932, 62 F.2d 601 , certiorari denied 1933, 289 U.S. 746 , 53 S.Ct. 689 , 77 L.Ed. 1492 [**33] , all of which involved contempt situations.
2 2.
Cammer was engaged in an official transaction .
That Cammer, as an "officer of the court," was engaged in an official transaction is clear.
The facts show beyond dispute that Cammer's actions occurred while he was directly engaged "in the practice of the profession."
Ex parte Bradley , supra, 7 Wall.
at page 374 , 19 L.Ed. 214 .
The grand jury had just indicted one of his clients, and as he knew, currently had others under investigation.
Each letter identified Cammer as attorney for the indicted client, Gold, and stated that he was addressing it to all federal government employees "who sat on the Grand Jury which indicted Mr.
Gold."
Cammer's letter, appealing directly to the grand jurors' purported duty "to help enlighten the court," transmitted a questionnaire containing inquiries, a few samples of which will demonstrate its inevitable impact on the grand jurors.
3 The grand jury is an appendage of the court and "proceedings before it are to be regarded as being proceedings in the court."
Camarota v. United States , 3 Cir., 1940, 111 F.2d 243, 246 , certiorari denied 1940, 311 U.S. 651 , 61 S.Ct. 16 , 85 L.Ed. 416 .
See also, United States v. Smyth , D.C.N.D.Cal.1952, 104 F.Supp.
283, 291 .
The grand jury acts "under the authority of the court," we note in Savin, Petitioner, 1889, 131 U.S. 267, 277 , 9 S.Ct. 699, 702 , which predicated Justice Cardozo's pronouncements "A talesman when accepted as a juror becomes a part or member of the court", Clark v. United States , 1933, 289 U.S. 1, 11 , and again at page 12, 53 S.Ct. 465 , at page 468, 77 L.Ed. 993 , "A talesman, sworn as a juror, becomes, like an attorney, an officer of the court, and must submit to like restraints."
That Cammer, in so communicating with an official arm of the court while conducting the court's business, was engaged in an official transaction cannot be doubted.
In urging that the statute does not apply in such circumstances appellant relies on the Nye, Michael and second Schmidt (6 Cir., 1941, 124 F.2d 177 ) cases.
The Nye proceedings, brought under the first subsection of 18 U.S.C. 401, did not involve an officer of the [**34] court, and the alleged contemnors, in fact, were not even parties to the litigation.
The Court's opinion stated, 313 U.S. at page 44 , 61 S.Ct. at page 814 : "The question is whether the conduct of petitioners constituted 'misbehavior .
.
.
so near' the presence of the court 'as to obstruct the administration of justice' .
. "
Concluding that the words have a geographical connotation, the majority ruled that the reprehensible conduct was not punishable as contempt within the meaning of 401(1) though of a kind which corrupts the judicial process and impedes the administration of justice.
The case on its facts has nothing to do with our problem.
In the Michael case, supra [ 326 U.S. 224 , 66 S.Ct. 78 ], the contemnor, a court appointed trustee, had been adjudged guilty of contempt because of "false and evasive" testimony before a grand jury.
The issues were not unlike those presented in Ex parte Hudgings , 1919, 249 U.S. 378 , 39 S.Ct. 337 , 63 L.Ed. 656 .
The Court noted that perjury alone does not constitute an "obstruction" of justice within 401(1), and that element must be clearly shown where contempt is charged.
The opinion cited Clark v. United States , supra , as an example of obstruction where a prospective juror had falsely testified in order to qualify.
"It is difficult to conceive of a more effective obstruction to the judicial process than a juror who has prejudged the case," wrote Justice Black, 326 U.S. at page 228 , 66 S.Ct. at page 80 , pointing out further that "the mere fact that false swearing is an incident to the obstruction charged does not immunize the culprit from contempt proceedings."
But perjury alone did not predicate contempt proceedings under 401(1), nor could the conviction be sustained under 401(2) where the contemnor, though an officer of the court, was not engaged in an official transaction while testifying generally before the grand jury.
In short, where the charge of perjury could be prosecuted with determination of guilt by a jury, that course, rather than summary contempt action, should be followed where there was lacking the element of obstruction of justice.
The Michael case offers no comfort to one who either sought to influence the jury as it transacted its business, or whose insinuating and unauthorized communications might have affected the grand jury's official consideration of the case against Cammer's clients.
4 In the second Schmidt case, as is clear from the facts which appear in the court's first opinion (6 Cir., 115 F.2d 394 ), the court again was concerned primarily with the first rather than the second subsection of 18 U.S.C. 401.
In fact, it was stated in open court by the Government that no complaint was made in that case under the second subsection.
Moreover, while attorneys were involved, they did not themselves make contacts with grand jurors, and their alleged contempts occurred when the court was not in session and grew out of actions they advised the clients to take.
In brief, the cases relied upon by appellant may be distinguished, and none involves direct dealing between two officers of the court in a matter of official concern to both, as in the present situation.
3.
Cammer's conduct constituted misbehavior .
For many practical reasons the courts have sought to protect grand juries in the exercise of their historic and important function, investing their deliberations with the seal of secrecy, protecting [**35] the jurors against harassment and otherwise recognizing their valued contributions in judicial administration.
5 Thus has evolved the rule requiring judicial approval of proposals to penetrate the shield.
Schmidt v. United States , 6 Cir., 1940, 115 F.2d 394, 397 , and cases there cited.
See also, United States v. American Medical Ass'n , D.C.D.C.1939, 26 F.Supp.
429 ; In re Bullock , D.C.D.C.1952, 103 F.Supp.
639 .
6 Cammer cast aside an unusually convenient opportunity to consult with the judge about his contemplated action when, while attorney for Gold who had been indicted, he appeared before the court on the morning of the very day the questionnaires were sent out.
He there sought to quash a subpoena duces tecum running to one of Gold's associates, and he knew that the grand jury was continuing its investigation.
If he had acted in good faith, he could then have sought judicial supervision, instead of which he went forward with his plan, kept it secret to himself, acted without advice from the court, and yet implied in his letter that it was the jurors' "duty" to the court to respond to the questionnaires.
The record here amply substantiates a finding of misbehavior.
As Judge Laws said in his opinion [ 122 F.Supp.
388 ]: "To harass [the jurors] by challenging and lengthy questions while they are deliberating or about to consider cases is intolerable.
A timid juror will not fail to be disturbed, possibly influenced.
A stalwart juror at least will be disturbed.
Such an approach impinges freedom of thought and decision.
Jurors will not serve competently if so harassed."
Conduct similar in principle to that involved here has been condemned in many other cases.
In Sinclair v. United States , 1929, 279 U.S. 749, 765 , 49 S.Ct. 471 , 73 L.Ed. 938 , the defendants in a criminal case had the jurors kept under surveillance whenever they were not actually within the court house.
Investigations also were made concerning encumbrances on the home of one juror and to determine whether another had indicated his views during the trial.
The Court upheld an adjudication of criminal contempt on these facts, even though it did not appear that any juror had actually been approached or communicated with or that any juror was conscious of the surveillance, although some jurors were suspicious.
The punishment included heavy fines and imprisonment.
Commenting on the conduct of the contemnors, the Court said, 279 U.S. at pages 764-765 , 49 S.Ct. at page 476 : [**36] In Ex parte Bradley , 1868, 7 Wall. 364, 374 , 19 L.Ed. 214 , the Court reversed a contempt adjudication against an attorney which had been premised on the first clause of the first section of the Act of March 2, 1831, which is the equivalent of 18 U.S.C. 401(1).
In so doing, however, the Court markedly contrasted the power of the courts under like circumstances "to punish attorneys as officers of the same, for misbehavior in the practice of the profession."
With respect to this latter power, Mr. Justice Nelson speaking for the Court said, 7 Wall.
at page 374 , 19 L.Ed. 214 : This distinction is recognized in the act of 1831, already referred to, which, after providing for personal contempt in presence of the court, authorizes attachments to issue, and summary punishment to be inflicted, for 'the misbehavior of the officers of said courts in their official transactions In Tanner v. United States , 10 Cir., 1933, 62 F.2d 601 , certiorari denied 1933, 289 U.S. 746 , 53 S.Ct. 689 , 77 L.Ed. 1492 , an attorney after the jury returned its verdict in a case in which he was participating, encountered one of the jurors and proceeded to abuse the juror, who was a banker, for the small amount of damages awarded his client in the trial.
The lawyer was adjudged in contempt, was fined $100, and suspended from practice until payment was made.
The Court of Appeals upheld this conviction and made this pertinent comment, 62 F.2d at page 602 : [**37] In the first Schmidt case, supra, 6 Cir., 1940, 115 F.2d 394 , several attorneys advised their clients that they could interrogate members of the grand jury relative to the evidence which had been submitted to it, and upon which indictments against them were based.
The clients thereupon approached and interviewed a number of the grand jurors, and obtained affidavits which the attorneys submitted to the court in support of motions to quash the indictments.
The attorneys were adjudged in contempt of court for their conduct.
Commenting upon the attorneys' actions, the court said, 115 F.2d at page 396 : 5 Cammer urges upon us his alleged lack of intent, that there was an absence of conscious wrong.
His reliance upon any such ground for exculpation is definitely misplaced.
"In order that one may be held for contempt for communications with jurors, on the ground of the harmful tendency thereof, it is not necessary to prove that the communications had or the acts done were accompanied with a wrongful intent.
It is sufficient if such acts and communications were knowingly and willfully done and had, and had the tendency to influence improperly the action of the jury."
Kelly v. United States , 9 Cir., 1918, 250 F. 947, 950 , certiorari denied 1919, 248 U.S. 585 , 39 S.Ct. 182 , 63 L.Ed. 433 .
In Duke v. United States , 4 Cir., 1937, 90 F.2d 840, 841 , 112 A.L.R. 317, certiorari denied 1937, 302 U.S. 685 , 58 S.Ct. 33 , 82 L.Ed. 528 , which arose under a statute which now appears at 18 U.S.C. 1504 (1952), the defendant was charged with improperly communicating [**38] with a grand jury.
Rejecting as a matter of law the defense that he had acted "openly and without corrupt intent," the court said that under the facts of the case "the only question which can arise under the statute is whether the person accused of sending the letter did so. Every one is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of acts intentionally done."
Once we find, as we do, that Cammer's conduct tended to harass the grand jurors, it is immaterial whether Cammer was motivated by an evil purpose, or not, but were we pressed on the point we could readily find that he was.
We are not unmindful that "the intention with which acts of contempt have been committed must necessarily and properly have an important bearing on the degree of guilt and the penalty which should be imposed .
. "
Cooke v. United States , 1925, 267 U.S. 517, 538 , 45 S.Ct. 390, 395 , 69 L.Ed. 767 .
Here the appellant had the full benefit of whatever mitigating circumstances could properly be urged in the light of the facts.
The Cooke case requires no more.
See also, Merrimack River Sav. Bank v. City of Clay Center , 1911, 219 U.S. 527, 536 , 31 S.Ct. 295 , 55 L.Ed. 320 ; Schmidt v. United States , 6 Cir., 1940, 115 F.2d 394, 398 .
Chief Judge Laws concluded [ 122 F.Supp.
389 ]: "Granting respondent all favorable inferences, his acts clearly disregarded the protection which must be vouchsafed jurors.
The Court finds him guilty of contempt and imposes a fine of $100."
The judgment is affirmed.
