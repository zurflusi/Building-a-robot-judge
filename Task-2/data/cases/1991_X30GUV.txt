 HOLLOWAY , Chief Judge.
In No. 89-7058, defendant Felix appeals his conviction in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Oklahoma, on various counts of a multi-count indictment charging him, inter alia , with conspiracy, manufacture, and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine.
He alleges that this conviction forced him to "run the gauntlet" again following a previous conviction in the United States District Court, Western District of Missouri, for a single count of attempt-to-manufacture methamphetamine, in violation of the protections afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause as recently construed in Grady v. Corbin , U.S. , 110 S.Ct. 2084 , 109 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990).
We agree that Felix has shown that his conviction on several counts in the Oklahoma trial entailed impermissible successive prosecutions for conduct underlying his Missouri conviction, and therefore we reverse his conviction on particular counts as enumerated below.
I Defendant Felix was convicted following a jury trial in the Eastern District of Oklahoma for violations of 21 U.S.C. 846 and 841(a)(1) ("the Oklahoma trial").
1 He had previously been convicted in the Western District of Missouri on a single count of attempt-to-manufacture methamphetamine, in violation of 841(a)(1) and 846 , ("the Missouri trial").
2 Both convictions arose from the following course of conduct and events: Sometime in the Spring of 1987, a meeting (or meetings) between defendant Felix and unindicted co-conspirator Paul Roach resulted in an agreement whereby Felix would provide financing and other support to Roach, in exchange for Roach's instruction and assistance in "cooking" methamphetamine.
A laboratory for the illegal enterprise was established in mobile trailers parked on an oil lease near Beggs, Oklahoma.
Felix and Roach obtained the chemicals and equipment for the Beggs lab in Tulsa, from George Dwinnells, a DEA confidential informant operating out of Tulsa Scientific, a chemical company.
As a result of information provided by Dwinnells, the DEA seized the unattended Beggs lab on July 13, 1987, while a "cook" was in progress.
Seized at the site were methamphetamine oil, illegal precursor chemicals, manufacturing equipment, and other evidence, some of which inculpated Felix.
Shortly thereafter, Felix phoned Dwinnells and arranged a meeting in a Tulsa bar.
At the bar, under the observation of DEA agents, Felix ordered more chemicals and equipment from Dwinnells, secured by a $7,500 down payment.
At Felix' behest, Dwinnells transported the newly purchased chemicals and equipment by trailer to a hotel in Joplin, Missouri.
Under the watchful eyes of the DEA, tipped off by Dwinnells, a controlled transfer of the trailer and its contents to Felix occurred.
He was arrested shortly thereafter.
Felix was tried before a jury on the attempt-to-manufacture charge in Springfield, Missouri on November 30, 1987 and convicted.
Before his April 1989 Oklahoma jury trial, Felix moved to dismiss the instant indictment on double jeopardy grounds arising from the Missouri conviction.
See Defendant Felix' Plea of Double Jeopardy and Motion To Dismiss The Indictment, TR. Vol I, Tab 2.
The trial judge in the Eastern District of Oklahoma denied Felix' motion by Order, dated March 20, 1989, holding: 846 Conspiracy Attempting TR.
Vol.
I, Tab 24, at 9 (emphasis in original).
II On appeal, Felix raises only one issue--that he was subjected to double jeopardy in violation of the Fifth Amendment, specifically the guarantee against being twice put on trial for the same offense.
He premises this claim of error on the denial of his motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy grounds.
For reasons given below, we are convinced that the Double Jeopardy Clause as interpreted recently in Grady v. Corbin , U.S. , 110 S.Ct. 2084 , 109 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990), requires the reversal of most of Felix' convictions.
The trial judge did not have the benefit of that recent opinion.
The Double Jeopardy Clause affords three guarantees: "It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.
It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction.
And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense."
North Carolina v. Pearce , 395 U.S. 711, 717 , 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2076 , 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969) (footnotes omitted).
Moreover, "it has long been understood that separate statutory crimes need not be identical--either in constituent elements or in actual proof--in order to be the same within the meaning of the constitutional prohibition."
Brown v. Ohio , 432 U.S. 161, 164 , 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2225 , 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977).
It is the second protection that Felix relies upon, namely, that he not be forced to undergo successive prosecutions for the same conduct.
General double jeopardy analysis earlier focused on the so-called traditional " Blockburger test" which states that: Blockburger v. United States , 284 U.S. 299, 304 , 52 S.Ct. 180, 182 , 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).
The focus of that test is on the elements of the crimes, and "[i]f each requires proof of a fact that the other does not, the Blockburger test is satisfied, notwithstanding a substantial overlap in the proof offered to establish the crimes."
Iannelli v. United States , 420 U.S. 770, 785 n. 17, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 1294 n. 17, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975) (citation omitted).
Recently, two significant opinions from the Supreme Court have shaped the double jeopardy analysis--first, Dowling v. United States , 493 U.S. 342 , 110 S.Ct. 668 , 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (1990), decided January 10, and second, the Grady case decided on May 29, 1990.
Grady in particular makes clear that the Double Jeopardy Clause protections extend beyond the limitations expressed in the much earlier Blockburger test.
In Dowling , the defendant had been convicted of bank robbery in part on the basis of testimony of Mrs. Henry.
Although she was not involved in the bank incident itself, her testimony supported the government's modus operandi evidence and established a link between Dowling and an alleged accomplice at the bank.
There the bank robber had worn a mask and carried a small pistol.
Mrs. Henry testified that during a burglary attempt at her home two weeks earlier, she had unmasked a man that she said was Dowling.
The man she struggled with was similarly, although not identically, masked and armed as the bank robber.
In a previous trial for burglary where Mrs. Henry testified as an eyewitness, Dowling had been acquitted.
The Court rejected a claim that the Double Jeopardy Clause and the Due Process Clause barred the use of Mrs. Henry's testimony at the bank robbery trial in light of the earlier acquittal.
Writing for the majority, Justice White made clear that "The issue is the inadmissibility of Henry's testimony."
The majority rejected Dowling's reliance on the double jeopardy principles established in Ashe v. Swenson , 397 U.S. 436 , 90 S.Ct. 1189 , 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970), because in the Dowling case, the prior acquittal "did not determine an ultimate issue in the present case." Dowling 's holding rests on two basic reasons.
First, there was a lower standard of proof applicable to the use of Ms. Henry's modus operandi evidence than in the first trial involving Dowling.
A jury might reasonably conclude that Dowling was the masked man who entered Mrs. Henry's home and give Rule 404(b) application to the evidence, even if it did not believe beyond a reasonable doubt that Dowling committed the crimes charged in the first trial.
Second, the Court deemed the evidence admissible because Dowling had not demonstrated that his acquittal in his first trial represented a jury determination that he was not one of the men who entered Mrs. Henry's home sufficient to justify application of Ashe 's collateral estoppel protection.
110 S.Ct. at 674 .
Dowling had actually not disputed his identity and instead argued that he was merely in Mrs. Henry's home to retrieve money from an individual in the house.
Thus, there was not the sharp determination of an issue in favor of Dowling as there was in Ashe .
Grady v. Corbin is a Double Jeopardy Clause application of much broader scope.
In Grady , defendant Corbin, who had been drinking, drove his car across the center line and struck two oncoming vehicles, killing one person and injuring another.
Although the assistant district attorney had responded to the accident and started an investigation, nevertheless, Corbin was issued two uniform traffic tickets for misdemeanor driving while intoxicated ("DWI") and failing to keep right of the median.
Despite the investigation, Corbin's trial on the traffic tickets proceeded unimpeded.
When the traffic court case was called, the prosecuting attorney was unaware that a death was involved and failed to object to the imposition of a minimal sentence after Corbin pled guilty.
Two months later, a grand jury indicted Corbin for reckless manslaughter, vehicular manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, third degree assault, and DWI.
In the bill of particulars, the three acts pled to establish the homicide and assault charges were (1) intoxicated driving, (2) failing to keep right of the median, and (3) driving too fast for weather and road conditions.
Corbin's motion to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds was rejected, and he sought a writ of prohibition to bar prosecution on all counts.
The Appellate Division denied the writ, but the New York Court of Appeals reversed.
The DWI count was found barred by the state constitution, and the manslaughter counts were found to violate Blockburger , as DWI was deemed a lesser included offense under state law.
The remaining homicide and assault counts were barred on Fifth Amendment grounds, and were the sole subject of the Supreme Court's review.
The Court barred Corbin's prosecution, using a two-step, double jeopardy analysis.
The first step is the traditional analysis: Blockburger Grady at 2090 (citing Brown ).
The Court noted, however, that the " Blockburger test is not the only standard for determining whether successive prosecutions impermissibly involve the same offense."
110 S.Ct. at 2092 (quoting Brown v. Ohio , 432 U.S. 161, 166-167 n. 6, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2226 n. 6, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977)).
The Grady opinion clearly defined a second step to the double jeopardy analysis: Blockburger Illinois v. Vitale 447 U.S. 410 100 S.Ct. 2260 65 L.Ed.2d 228 See Dowling v. United States 493 U.S. 110 S.Ct. 668 107 L.Ed.2d 708 110 S.Ct. at 2093 .
3 As yet, few appellate courts have construed Grady , 4 but its intended breadth is obvious from its language.
The Third Circuit has said that "the language employed by the [ Grady ] Court in its formulation of the 'same conduct' test could be interpreted as extending double jeopardy protection to all situations where the government intends again to prove conduct constituting an offense subject to an earlier conviction."
United States v. Pungitore , 910 F.2d 1084, 1110 (3d Cir.1990).
The Third Circuit, however, declined to adopt that stance believing that "[t]he double jeopardy analysis in Brown and Grady , , cannot easily be transposed to the RICO context[.]"
Id.
We note, however, that the Third Circuit's analysis stems from an approach to double jeopardy issues that this circuit has already rejected, and is thus inapposite.
5 We are in accord with the more recent application of Grady in United States v. Calderone and Catalano , 917 F.2d 717 (2nd Cir.1990).
There the Second Circuit reversed the district court's denial of defendants' motion to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds, one judge dissenting.
At their first trial, Calderone and Catalano had been granted a directed verdict based on the insufficiency of the evidence against them in an international, multi-drug smuggling conspiracy trial.
Immediately after the directed verdict, the government filed a new indictment against them.
The second indictment charged a narrower conspiracy to distribute heroin in New York City, along with 24 counts of telephone use to facilitate the crimes, and 3 counts of distribution.
This "smaller" conspiracy overlapped the earlier one as to time and some overt acts.
The Calderone court held that "the 'same conduct' test announced in Grady bars prosecution of all counts of the indictment."
917 F.2d at 720 .
The court, as we do, found the scope of Grady to be of some breadth: "the 'same conduct' test announced in Grady applies to all double jeopardy claims arising in the context of successive prosecutions."
917 F.2d at 721 .
More importantly, Calderone rejected the same argument advanced by the government here, namely, that the evidence presented at both trials was not used to prove the same conduct because the conduct proven was a distinct conspiratorial agreement.
See Appellee's brief at 16-17.
As explained in Calderone : Grady 917 F.2d at 721 .
The government, then, cannot avoid the strictures of the Double Jeopardy Clause merely by indicting and convicting Felix on statutorily distinct charges.
As shown below, the fact that Felix' two trials constitute successive prosecutions arising from virtually the same conduct involving the same actors and overlapping time frames signals the need to apply the Grady double jeopardy analysis.
A court should carefully apply double jeopardy analysis where a defendant's constitutional rights are threatened by prosecutors who have the opportunity to draft indictments in which they can allege apparently separate criminal conduct.
See Calderone , 917 F.2d at 721, 722 (Newman, J., concurring).
Considering, as we must, the proper application of both Grady and Dowling , we are persuaded that Grady lays down the principle which applies with special force here.
Dowling and Grady are not contradictory and we can, and must, give full application to both holdings.
Dowling concerned, as noted, the admissibility of evidence in conformity with the collateral estoppel principle of Ashe 6 ; Grady concerned the protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause from successive prosecutions for the same conduct which is violative of criminal statutes.
It is this latter protection under the Clause which is implicated here and this causes us to focus mainly on the teaching of Grady .
We now turn to the facts of the instant case which we will consider under these principles.
III Consideration of the record of the Oklahoma trial and the evidence summarized by the Eighth Circuit in the Missouri trial shows significant duplication of the conduct proved to establish the Missouri offense and most of the Oklahoma convictions.
Evidence as to such conduct comes from the testimony of the following witnesses, presented at both trials: Paul Roach (Government Witness); George Dwinnells (DEA Confidential Informant); John Coonce (DEA agent); and Carolyn Ruybal (DEA chemist).
See generally Felix , 867 F.2d at 1070-71 ; TR.
Vol. V, 317-76, 475-82; TR.
Vol. VI, 792-93; TR.
Vol. VII, 898, 912.
The Eighth Circuit described the conduct found sufficient to convict Felix of the attempt to manufacture methamphetamine, in part, as follows: Felix , 867 F.2d at 1071 (citation omitted).
In the subsequent prosecution in Oklahoma, a number of the counts in the indictment were based on proof of the same conduct.
As to Count 1, the conspiracy charge, the duplication was extensive, contrary to Grady .
In both trials it was proven that Felix met with Roach and agreed to furnish him chemicals and equipment so that under Roach's tutelage, methamphetamine could be produced.
See Felix , 867 F.2d at 1070 ; and here, TR.
Vol. V, 317, 337-39, 341, 357, 373-76.
Furthermore, it was proven at both trials that Felix met Dwinnells in a Tulsa bar, informed him of the Beggs lab bust, and gave him a $7,500 down payment with an order for chemicals and equipment to manufacture methamphetamine.
Felix later called to increase his order, and instructed Dwinnells to deliver the chemicals and equipment to him in Joplin, Missouri.
Felix then met Dwinnells in Joplin and took possession of the goods.
See Felix , 867 F.2d at 1070-71 and n. 4; and here, TR.
Vol. V, 475-82; TR.
Vol. VI, 792-93.
This conduct was alleged in Overt Acts 17 and 18 of the Oklahoma conspiracy charge, Count 1, and was used to show that Felix had conspired to manufacture methamphetamine in the Oklahoma case. 7 Previously in Missouri, however, the identical conduct established both the intent and "substantial step" elements of the attempt to manufacture methamphetamine charge.
In fact, the government's response below to Felix' motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds makes clear the violation of the Grady principles: was the activity leading to defendant's conviction for attempted manufacture in the Western District of Missouri Government Response below, p. 2 (emphasis added).
In addition to the overlap in the conduct giving rise to the successive prosecutions, the two offenses did not involve distinct persons, places, or times.
Both prosecutions focused on Felix and Roach as the actors.
Both prosecutions presented evidence of acts occurring outside the borders of the respective states in which the trials took place.
The instant indictment alleged that the conspiracy took place in the "Eastern District of Oklahoma and elsewhere ."
United States v. Felix , Indictment No. 89-16-CR (emphasis added).
Similarly, the indictment alleged that one of the means of the conspiracy was to manufacture drugs for distribution in the "Eastern District of Oklahoma and elsewhere ."
Id. (emphasis added).
Overt act No. 18 alleged that on August 31, 1987, Felix, "while at a location in Missouri, possessed chemicals and equipment necessary in the manufacture of methamphetamine."
Finally, the relevant time frames of the two indictments also overlap.
The Missouri prosecution was premised on conduct that occurred from the spring of 1987 to August 31, 1987.
Felix , 867 F.2d at 1070 .
The Oklahoma prosecution was premised on conduct that occurred from "about" May 1, 1987 to August 31, 1987 (Count 1); and on July 13, 1987 (Counts 2, 3, 4, and 5).
Accordingly, under the clear principle pronounced in Grady against successive prosecutions for the same conduct, we hold that the successive prosecution of Felix in Oklahoma for the same conduct for which he was previously convicted in Missouri violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.
Thus the Count 1 conspiracy conviction of Felix in the instant case cannot stand.
As to the substantive offenses charged in Counts 2 through 5, in both trials it was proven that Roach and Felix bought chemicals and equipment from Dwinnells at Tulsa Scientific for the purpose of manufacturing and distributing methamphetamine.
See Felix , 867 F.2d at 1070-71 ; and here, TR.
Vol. V, 346-48, 356.
They used these chemicals and equipment to create precursor chemicals ( e.g. , methamphetamine oil and phenylacetone), which in turn were subsequently used to generate methamphetamine at the Beggs, Oklahoma lab. Felix , 867 F.2d at 1070-71 ; and here, TR.
Vol. V, 346-48, 354-56, 360-62, 367-68, 370-71.
This conduct served to establish the intent element of the attempt to manufacture methamphetamine in the Missouri trial; it also served as factual support for Felix' convictions in Oklahoma of possessing precursor chemicals (Counts 4 and 5), and manufacturing and possessing with intent to distribute methamphetamine (Counts 2 and 3).
Hence, Felix' conviction on these Counts must also be reversed.
Likewise Count 6 of the Oklahoma indictment clearly was a successive prosecution for conduct that was the subject of the Missouri prosecution.
Count 6 here charged that from on or about June 1, 1987, in the Eastern District of Oklahoma, Felix and co-defendant Pinter maintained and/or made available a place and enclosure for manufacturing methamphetamine/amphetamine.
Proof during the Oklahoma trial included Roach's testimony that he knew Felix in about May 1987, V R. 316; that in Texas Felix discussed finding a place to set up "the lab," id. at 337 ; Felix said he wanted Roach to take some of the glassware to Okmulgee, Oklahoma; Roach met a man named B.J.
(codefendant Pinter) there and they went to a location near Beggs, Oklahoma (which is in Okmulgee, County), id. at 344 ; Felix showed up and they discussed the glassware, id. at 346-47 ; Felix and Roach went to Tulsa and bought glassware, id. at 347-48 ; after Father's Day, Felix and Roach had conversations at the lab site and Felix and Roach "just kind of worked together on [throwing away trash at the lab site]."
Id. at 368 .
Dennis [Felix] paid Roach $4,000 cash for Roach's part of the lab work; they did 4, 5 or maybe 6 cooks.
Id. at 370 .
This proof offered to support Count 6 of the Oklahoma indictment was close to that outlined in the Eighth Circuit Felix opinion on Roach's testimony that Felix furnished Roach methamphetamine-making chemicals during the Spring of 1987; that he and Felix bought chemicals and equipment in Tulsa and eventually cooked methamphetamine in a trailer near Beggs; and that on July 13, 1987, officers seized the trailer near Beggs.
Felix , 867 F.2d at 1070 .
The evidence of this conduct was identified by the Eighth Circuit as presented in connection with the essential elements of the attempt to manufacture methamphetamine prosecution in the Missouri federal case: (1) an intent to engage in the criminal conduct; and (2) conduct constituting a "substantial step" toward the substantive offense, strongly corroborating the actor's criminal intent.
Felix , 867 F.2d at 1071 .
The subsequent Oklahoma trial on such evidence of knowingly maintaining a place for manufacturing the controlled substance (see allegations of Count 6, note 1, supra ) thus subjected Felix to a successive trial for the same conduct, contrary to Grady .
Thus the Count 6 conviction also cannot stand.
We conclude, however, that the defendant Felix has not shown grounds for disturbing his convictions and sentences on Counts 9 and 10.
The defendant bears the burden of proving a double jeopardy claim.
United States v. Cardall , 885 F.2d 656, 665 (10th Cir.1989).
Count 9 charged interstate travel on or about June 21, 1987 from Texas to the Eastern District of Oklahoma and elsewhere with intent to promote, etc., the management, etc., of manufacture of methamphetamine/amphetamine.
Count 10 made similar allegations of interstate travel on or about July 13, 1987, from Texas to the Eastern District of Oklahoma and elsewhere with the intent to promote, etc., the same unlawful conduct.
The closest that the conduct outlined in the Eighth Circuit Felix opinion gets to the conduct charged in the instant Counts 9 and 10 is presented by an allegation that on July 13, 1987, law enforcement officers seized the trailer near Beggs, Oklahoma; that Felix instructed Dwinnells to deliver chemicals and equipment to the Joplin, Missouri Holiday Inn; that Felix and Dwinnells met at that motel where Felix had rented a room; and that a controlled delivery was arranged to be made in Joplin on August 31, 1987.
867 F.2d at 1070-71 .
We cannot agree that the double jeopardy claim was established as to the Count 9 and 10 convictions and sentences, which was a burden the defendant Felix had to carry.
8 In sum, we conclude that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment barred defendant Felix' successive prosecution on Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the Oklahoma indictment and his convictions, sentences, and special $50 assessments on those Counts are REVERSED.
His convictions on Counts 9 and 10 need not be disturbed and are AFFIRMED; however, the case is remanded for re-sentencing on said Counts 9 and 10.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
