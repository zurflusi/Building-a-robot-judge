 ORDER The majority opinion filed September 6, 2002, and appearing at 305 F.3d 875 (9th Cir.2002), is hereby amended as follows: 1. slip op. at 13347, line 18 [ 305 F.3d at 878 ]: after " See " and before the citation to James v. Pliler , insert " Kelly v. Small , 315 F.3d 1063, 1070-71 (9th Cir.2003);" 2. slip op. at 13347, line 18 [ 305 F.3d at 878 ]: after the above new citation to Kelly v. Small , insert the following footnote:"As our dissenting colleague is well aware, in the course of confronting similar issues, the Kelly panel and this panel arrived at the same conclusions at approximately the same time, and filed their respective opinions within days of each other.
Because we are part of a larger collegial body, and because it is our general practice to try to make our opinions as consistent as possible, both panels decided to make several harmonizing modifications to their originally filed opinions.
Each panel amended its opinion to refer to the other, in part to make the coordination of our dispositions clear.
We are, accordingly, puzzled that the dissent should find our action 'bizarre.'"

[¶] We have recognized a district court's obligation to avoid misleading petitioners.

with".
The Fifth Circuit recently found similar circumstances appropriate for equitable tolling in the context of a prisoner's 1983 suit dismissed ostensibly without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
In Clifford v. Gibbs , 298 F.3d 328 (5th Cir.2002), the court recognized the impropriety of a dismissal without prejudice that actually left claims 'forever precluded.'
Id. at 333 .
It held that claims should be equitably tolled when the 'district court's dismissal without prejudice actually operates as a dismissal with prejudice because [the petitioner] is barred from returning to federal court after exhausting his remedies because limitations has already run.'
Id. Ford faced the same constraints."

29. slip op. at 13375, line 20 [ 305 F.3d at 894 ]: after "This is a far cry from what the majority holds today," insert the following two new paragraphs: The majority's reliance on Valerio v. Crawford , 306 F.3d 742 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc) is likewise misplaced.
Valerio involved highly unusual procedural circumstances of nearly Talmudic complexity, circumstances too convoluted to recount here.
But in a nutshell, this court itself created a mixed petition for the petitioner by reinstating, on appeal, new unexhausted claims that had been dismissed by the district court for abuse of the writ.
In a portion of the opinion entitled, "Procedure on Remand," the court sought to bring some order to the chaos by giving the district court detailed instructions on how to proceed from that point on, including the direction to inform Valerio of a possible time-bar in the event that the district court were to decline to follow the stay-and-abeyance procedure on remand.
In no way, shape or form can Valerio be read to require Miranda -like, warnings about the statute of limitations in the garden variety mixed-petition case. The majority's reliance on Kelly v. Small , 315 F.3d 1063 (9th Cir.2003), is simply bizarre.
The amended Kelly opinion was filed after the original opinion in this case ( Ford ) and relies on the original Ford opinion for support.
Id. at 1070-71 .
Now, in its amended opinion, the majority in this case ( Ford ) relies on Kelly , which in turn relies on Ford .
The wacky circularity of all of this does not change the fact that it was the Ford majority in this case that originally cooked up the rule on which the Kelly court relied, and with which I respectfully disagree for the reasons I've given.

The full court was advised of the suggestion for rehearing en banc.
A judge of the court requested a vote on whether to rehear the matter en banc.
The matter failed to receive a majority of the votes of the nonrecused active judges in favor of en banc reconsideration.

P. 35 .
The petition for rehearing and the suggestion for rehearing en banc are DENIED.
