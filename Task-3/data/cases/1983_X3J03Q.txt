 McMILLIAN , Circuit Judge.
George Johnson appeals from a final order entered in the District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas dismissing his petition for writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. 2254 .
For reversal petitioner argues that the district court erroneously refused (1) to grant specific performance of a proposed plea bargain and (2) to shift the burden of proof to the state to show that petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel was not prejudicial.
For the reasons discussed below, we reverse and remand.
Petitioner's case, like those of many other state habeas petitioners, has become procedurally complicated.
For a statement of the facts underlying petitioner's criminal convictions, see Johnson v. State , 252 Ark. 1113 , 482 S.W.2d 600 (1972).
According to the evidence presented by the state, in May 1970 petitioner and Eddie Jackson broke into the house of W.A.
Siscoe with the intent to commit burglary.
Mr. and Mrs. Siscoe and their daughter Vicki arrived home in the middle of the burglary.
Vicki was the first person to enter the house; she confronted the intruders and screamed.
Mr. Siscoe heard Vicki's screams and entered the house.
One of the intruders threatened to kill him and grabbed Vicki and used her to shield his escape from the house.
At this point shots were exchanged by one of the intruders and Mr. Siscoe.
Vicki was fatally wounded, and petitioner and Mr. Siscoe were wounded.
Petitioner was convicted of first degree murder for the death of Vicki Siscoe and sentenced to life imprisonment.
Petitioner was subsequently convicted of burglary and assault with intent to kill on June 15, 1971; these charges arose out of the same incident.
Petitioner was sentenced to 21 years imprisonment for the burglary and 12 years for the assault, to be served concurrently.
On July 17, 1972, petitioner's murder conviction was reversed by the Arkansas Supreme Court for failure to give a requested jury instruction and remanded for a new trial.
Johnson v. State , 482 S.W.2d at 606 .
The state trial court appointed Harold Hall of the public defender's office to represent petitioner.
The following facts about the plea bargaining negotiations are not disputed.
On Friday, October 27, 1972, the prosecuting attorney contacted Hall and proposed a 21-year sentence, to be served concurrently with petitioner's burglary and assault sentences, in exchange for a guilty plea to the charge of accessory after a felony murder.
Hall told petitioner the terms the next day, Saturday, October 28, 1972.
Petitioner agreed to accept the plea proposal.
The following Monday, October 30, 1972, Hall called the prosecuting attorney and accepted the plea bargain.
However, the prosecuting attorney told Hall that a mistake had been made and withdrew the proposal.
The prosecuting attorney then proposed a recommendation of a 21-year sentence to be served consecutively to petitioner's other sentences.
Apparently Hall did not respond to this second proposal and assigned the case to another public defender, John Achor.
Petitioner proceeded to trial November 8, 1972.
On November 9, 1972, the trial court declared a mistrial, evidently on the ground of prejudicial newspaper publicity, excused the jury and rescheduled the trial for December 7, 1972.
The trial was later continued to February 26, 1973, when petitioner entered a guilty plea to the charge of accessory after a felony murder and was sentenced to 21 years imprisonment, to be served consecutively to the burglary and assault sentences.
Petitioner sought post-conviction relief in the state courts on the grounds of mistake and ineffective assistance of counsel.
The state trial court denied relief and its decision was affirmed by the Arkansas Supreme Court in an unpublished opinion, Johnson v. State , No. CR-78-18 (Ark. June 5, 1978).
Petitioner then filed the petition for writ of habeas corpus, alleging mistake, coercion and ineffective assistance of counsel.
Petitioner argued that he did not understand the nature and consequences of the plea bargain and pled guilty only because his defense attorney threatened him with life imprisonment if he went to trial.
Petitioner also argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his defense attorney did not discuss the case with him until ten minutes before trial, failed to interview witnesses and did not explain the nature and consequences of the plea bargain.
The district court referred the petition to a magistrate for an evidentiary hearing and report and recommendation.
Petitioner, Hall and Achor testified at the first evidentiary hearing in August 1979.
At this point petitioner raised an additional constitutional issue, alleging that the prosecuting attorney's withdrawal of the plea bargain proposal after petitioner's acceptance was unconstitutional.
The magistrate held supplemental evidentiary hearings in October and December 1980, at which petitioner, Lacey Gordon 1 and Benny Kelley 2 testified.
The district court adopted the magistrate's report and recommendation, Johnson v. Mabry , No. PB-C-78-139 (E.D.Ark.
Sept. 17, 1981), finding that petitioner's mistaken belief about the sentence he would receive if he pled guilty was not reasonably justified, 3 that petitioner's guilty plea was not induced by threats or misrepresentations by defense counsel, 4 and that petitioner was not prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel.
5 The court also rejected petitioner's claim that the prosecuting attorney's withdrawal of the plea bargain proposal was unconstitutional.
6 Slip op. at 11-12, citing Government of Virgin Islands v. Scotland , 614 F.2d 360, 363-65 (3d Cir.1980) ( Scotland ).
The district court dismissed the petition and this appeal followed.
On appeal petitioner argues that (1) he has a constitutional right to enforcement of the plea bargain proposal and (2) because of the changed circumstances beyond petitioner's control, the court should have shifted the burden of proof to the state on the question of the absence of prejudice.
Because we agree with petitioner's first argument, we do not reach the burden of proof question.
See note 5 supra .
In 1971 the Supreme Court recognized that the "disposition of criminal charges by agreement between the prosecutor and the accused, sometimes loosely called 'plea bargaining,' is an essential component of the administration of justice," which, if "[p]roperly administered, is to be encouraged."
Santobello v. New York , 404 U.S. 257, 260 , 92 S.Ct. 495, 498 , 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971); see also Brady v. United States , 397 U.S. 742, 751-52 , 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1470-71 , 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970) (discussing advantages of plea bargained dispositions for criminal justice administration).
The Court's approval of plea bargaining "presuppose[d] fairness in securing agreement between an accused and a prosecutor."
Santobello v. New York , 404 U.S. at 261 , 92 S.Ct. at 498 .
The Court held that "[t]his phase of the process of criminal justice, and the adjudicative element inherent in accepting a plea of guilty, must be attended by safeguards to insure the defendant what is reasonably due in the circumstances."
Id. at 262 , 92 S.Ct. at 499 .
The source of the fairness requirement is constitutional, presumably substantive due process, see Cooper v. United States , 594 F.2d 12, 15-16 (4th Cir.1979) ( Cooper ); see also Santobello v. New York , 404 U.S. at 266-67 , 92 S.Ct. at 500-01 (Douglas, J., concurring) (specifically noting that Santobello is a state case over which the Supreme Court has no supervisory jurisdiction and recognizing a constitutional basis for the holding); Westen & Westin, A Constitutional Law of Remedies for Broken Plea Bargains , 66 Calif.L.Rev.
471, 474-75 n. 10, 476 n. 16 (1978) (hereinafter Broken Plea Bargains ); Comment, Specific Enforcement to Ensure Due Process in Plea Bargaining , 21 Wm. & Mary L.Rev.
521 (1979), and mandates that "the most meticulous standards of both promise and performance must be met by prosecutors engaging in plea bargaining."
Correale v. United States , 479 F.2d 944, 947 (1st Cir.1973); see United States v. Bowler , 585 F.2d 851, 854 (7th Cir.1978) ("to protect the plea bargaining defendant from overreaching by the prosecutor and to insure the integrity of the plea bargaining process"); Palermo v. Warden , 545 F.2d 286, 296 (2d Cir.), cert. denied , 431 U.S. 911 , 97 S.Ct. 2166 , 53 L.Ed.2d 221 (1976); Geisser v. United States , 513 F.2d 862, 863 (5th Cir.1973), cert. denied , 450 U.S. 1031 , 101 S.Ct. 1741 , 68 L.Ed.2d 226 (1981) (following several remands).
In general the legal analysis in plea bargaining cases has relied heavily upon contract law principles, in particular emphasizing contract formation (offer and acceptance), breach, estoppel (entry of guilty plea or detrimental reliance), and remedies (rescission or specific performance).
See, e.g. , Scotland , 614 F.2d at 364 ; 7 Cooper , 594 F.2d at 16 (citing cases from Fourth Circuit); People v. Calloway , 29 Cal.3d 666 , 631 P.2d 30 , 175 Cal.Rptr.
596 (1981) (bank); People v. Kaanehe , 19 Cal.3d 1 , 559 P.2d 1028 , 136 Cal.Rptr.
409 (1977); Shields v. State , 374 A.2d 816, 819 (Del.), cert. denied , 434 U.S. 893 , 98 S.Ct. 271 , 54 L.Ed.2d 180 (1977); see generally Broken Plea Bargains , 66 Calif.L.Rev.
at 525.
Other cases, however, have recognized that contract law is useful only as an analogy.
See United States v. Calabrese , 645 F.2d 1379, 1390 (10th Cir.) (analogy to contract law is not determinative in plea negotiations), cert. denied , 451 U.S. 1018 , 101 S.Ct. 3008 , 69 L.Ed.2d 390 (1981); Cooper , 594 F.2d at 16-20 ; United States ex rel.
Selikoff v. Commissioner of Correction , 524 F.2d 650, 654 (2d Cir.1975), cert. denied , 425 U.S. 951 , 96 S.Ct. 1725 , 48 L.Ed.2d 194 (1976); cf.
Brewer v. Williams , 430 U.S. 387, 401 n. 8, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 1241 n. 8, 51 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977) ("We do not deal here with notions of offer, acceptance, consideration, or other concepts of the law of contracts.
We deal with constitutional law.
"); Roe v. United States Attorney , 618 F.2d 980, 981 (2d Cir.) (per curiam) (court of appeals will not use doctrine of actual authority in context of promises made by government officials), cert. denied , 449 U.S. 856 , 101 S.Ct. 152 , 66 L.Ed.2d 70 (1981); United States v. Bowler , 585 F.2d at 854 ("A plea agreement is not an appropriate context for the Government to resort to a rigidly literal approach in the construction of language.").
See generally Broken Plea Bargains , 66 Calif.L.Rev.
at 527-28 (proposing theory of "constitutional contracts").
The analogy between contracts and plea agreements works well in the usual plea bargain case, which involves the entry of a guilty plea, or the performance of some other action, following plea negotiations and an agreement about specific terms.
E.g. , United States v. Runck , 601 F.2d 968, 970 (8th Cir.1979) (on petition for rehearing) (following entry of negotiated plea, dispute arose over whether part of sentence was within plea agreement accepted by district court).
Traditional contract principles, however, are of little guidance in a plea proposal case like the present one.
Here, as in Cooper and Scotland , we are confronted with a fact situation that falls short of a plea bargain.
8 Petitioner did not enter a plea of guilty in court and has not performed any specific action in reliance upon the plea bargain.
Compare Palermo v. Warden , 545 F.2d at 290 (defendants offered reduced sentences and early parole in exchange for return of stolen jewelry); see United States v. Bowler , 585 F.2d at 852 (plea agreement provided for dismissal of counts and recommended sentence if defendant cooperated in further prosecutions and other investigations).
However, petitioner did rely on the plea proposal to the extent that he considered the terms offered, agreed to accept the plea proposal and communicated his willingness to plead guilty to the prosecuting attorney.
In Cooper the Fourth Circuit found "the constitutional right to 'fairness' [set forth in Santobello ] to be wider in scope than that defined by the law of contract" and recognized "a constitutional right to enforcement of plea proposals [which] may arise before any technical 'contract' has been formed, and on the basis alone of expectations reasonably formed in reliance upon the honor of the government in making and abiding by its proposals."
594 F.2d at 16-18 (footnotes omitted).
The Cooper court based this constitutional right on substantive due process: it is simply unfair to permit the government in effect to go back on its word.
Id. at 18-19 ; cf.
Broken Plea Bargains , 66 Calif.L.Rev.
at 513 (arguing that Santobello can be understood as extending constitutional protection to the personal expectations created in defendants by plea agreements with the state).
The Cooper court also relied upon the sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel: 594 F.2d at 18-19 (footnote omitted).
The holding in Cooper was very narrow: Id. at 19 ; see note 8 supra (listing specific factual considerations relied upon by court).
Cf. Comment, 21 Wm. & Mary L.Rev.
at 536-39 (arguing procedural due process as preferable constitutional basis for Cooper holding).
The Third Circuit in Scotland rejected the Fourth Circuit's due process analysis on the grounds that it not only interfered with prosecutorial discretion 9 and discouraged pleas, 10 but, more importantly, was unnecessary because, in the absence of detrimental reliance, a jury trial is an adequate remedy. 11 614 F.2d at 364-65 .
The Third Circuit also found no implication of the sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel in the government's withdrawal of the plea proposal.
12 We believe that the Cooper analysis should be followed.
This approach recognizes the limited usefulness of contract principles in the plea bargaining context.
Plea bargaining involves more than commercial law.
Because the entry of a guilty plea constitutes a waiver of fundamental constitutional rights, Santobello v. New York , 404 U.S. at 264 , 92 S.Ct. at 500 (Douglas, J., concurring), plea bargains are not just contracts in which the prosecution exchanges the dismissal or reduction of charges and recommendations on sentencing for the defendant's guilty plea.
Imposing upon the government the duty to conduct plea bargaining with scrupulous fairness, which, in the present case, would require the government to honor the terms of its plea proposal, is consistent with the "fairness" requirement set forth in Santobello .
As noted in Cooper , "constitutional decisions cannot be made to turn in favor of the government on the fortuities of communications or on a refusal to accord any substantive value to reasonably induced expectations that government will honor its firmly advanced proposals."
594 F.2d at 17 .
We do not agree that the Cooper analysis improperly restricts prosecutorial discretion.
The government does not have to initiate or participate in plea bargaining.
See Weatherford v. Bursey , 429 U.S. 545, 561 , 97 S.Ct. 837, 846 , 51 L.Ed.2d 30 (1977).
However, once the government does so, it must negotiate with "scrupulous fairness."
Cooper does not restrict the particular terms that the government may propose during plea negotiations; the government may make conditional proposals and may withdraw or modify outstanding proposals that have not been accepted or rejected after a reasonable period of time.
Cooper does, however, require the government to honor whatever terms it has proposed if they are promptly and unequivocally agreed to by the defendant.
In practice, this means that government attorneys may have to become better organized and scrutinize plea proposals before discussing them with defense counsel.
See 594 F.2d at 20 .
Further, requiring the government to conduct plea negotiations in a more orderly manner should not necessarily discourage guilty pleas.
A more orderly method should reduce arbitrary action and promote greater consistency in the disposition of similar cases, thus encouraging defendants to enter pleas.
See Comment, 21 Wm. & Mary L.Rev.
at 536-38.
Moreover, Cooper expressly contemplates that the government can withdraw a plea proposal or reopen plea negotiations, even after the plea proposal has been accepted by the defendant, if the government demonstrates that the plea proposal was based upon inaccurate or incomplete information, for example, if the defendant misrepresents or conceals relevant information or there is additional information that was not reasonably discoverable at the time the plea proposal was offered.
594 F.2d at 19 .
Nor can we agree that a jury trial is an adequate remedy in cases like the present one.
In terms of the contract law analogy, trial does not provide the defendant with the benefit of the bargain, that is, jury trial will not protect the defendant's reasonable expectations that the government will honor its proposals.
Nor does the alternative of jury trial really address the conduct of the government.
We are concerned here with what the Fourth Circuit in United States v. Carter , 454 F.2d 426, 428 (4th Cir.1972) (banc), cert. denied , 417 U.S. 933 , 94 S.Ct. 2646 , 41 L.Ed.2d 237 (1974) (following remand), characterized as "the honor of the government" and "public confidence in the fair administration of justice."
Here, the government in effect promised to recommend a specific sentence if petitioner agreed to plead guilty to a specific charge.
If we were to hold that jury trial is an adequate remedy in these circumstances, we would have no effective way to discourage the potential abuse of the plea bargaining process.
We will not allow the government to take advantage of petitioner's acceptance of the plea proposal, in the absence of any change in the underlying circumstances, and to exploit petitioner's decision to plead guilty by further hard bargaining and by recommending a longer sentence.
Compare Bordenkircher v. Hayes , 434 U.S. 357, 360-65 , 98 S.Ct. 663, 666-69 , 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978) (no violation of due process by prosecutor who carries out threat made during plea negotiations to have accused reindicted on more serious charges on which he is plainly subject to prosecution if he does not plead guilty to offense with which he was originally charged).
In sum, we stress that our holding, like that in Cooper , is very narrow and dependent upon the specific facts.
See note 8 supra .
The appropriate remedy is a difficult problem in plea bargain cases.
E.g. , Santobello v. New York , 404 U.S. at 263 , 92 S.Ct. at 499 (specific performance or withdrawal of plea); id. at 266-67 , 92 S.Ct. at 501 (Douglas, J., concurring); Correale v. United States , 479 F.2d at 949-50 ; see also Broken Plea Bargains , 66 Calif.L.Rev.
at 474-76.
Here, petitioner seeks enforcement of the plea proposal.
Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of the petition for habeas corpus and remand the case to the district court with directions to grant the writ of habeas corpus unless the state resentences petitioner in accordance with the concurrent sentence plea proposal within 120 days of the filing of this opinion.
