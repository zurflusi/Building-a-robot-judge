 PER CURIAM.
These three appeals have been consolidated by this court.
In our view Nos.
18,068 and 18,072 should be disposed of first, although they are later in their numbering.
In No. 18,068 , the National Mediation Board appeals from an order issued by the District Court which, among other things, restrains the Board from conducting a representation election.
In No. 18,072 , the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employes appeals from the same order.
The order appealed from is as follows: RDERED URTHER RDERED 45 U.S.C. 151 The opinion of Judge Youngdahl, of the District Court, is found in D.C.D.C., 218 F.Supp.
114 (1963) and is adopted by us as the opinion of this court.
It follows that the judgment of the District Court in these cases must be affirmed.
In No. 17,777 , United Air Lines, Inc. appeals from the dismissal by the District Court of its action filed to enjoin the election proposed by the National Mediation Board.
The grounds for dismissal of the action are not stated in the court's order but, as one of the grounds urged was lack of standing on the part of United Air Lines, we assume it was on this ground that the suit was dismissed.
The close question as to United's standing, about which there is a dearth of authority, causes us concern.
We have decided, however, not to disturb the District Court's dismissal, because our decision in the other two cases affords the relief concerning the form of the ballot which United sought.
No. 18,068 is affirmed.
No. 18,072 is affirmed.
No. 17,777 is affirmed.
