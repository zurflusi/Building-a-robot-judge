 SCHNACKENBERG , Circuit Judge.
United States of America, defendant, appeals from a judgment of the district court for $76,841.77 with interest, against it and in favor of plaintiffs, Charles E. O'Malley, Claude C. Alexander and Peter G. Farrow, as executors of the will of Edward H. Fabrice, deceased.
The stipulated facts reveal that this action is for refund of federal estate tax paid to defendant by plaintiffs, and arises under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. 1 et seq.
Edward H. Fabrice, a resident of Illinois, died on October 13, 1949.
In December, 1936, and January, 1937, Fabrice created five irrevocable trusts naming himself and two other persons as co-trustees.
The trust instruments were substantially identical except for the names of the beneficiaries and the property transferred.
Fabrice's daughter Janet was the beneficiary of two of the trusts, his daughter Lorraine was beneficiary of two other trusts and his wife was to receive the benefit of the fifth trust.
Under each of the five trusts, the co-trustees retained the right to distribute or accumulate the income of the trusts and the income accumulated was to become part of the principal.
Fabrice retained no power to revoke, change or modify the terms of the trusts for his benefit or in any way by which he could ever acquire any interest in the corpus or income of the trusts.
When Fabrice died in 1949, the total assets in the trusts had a value of $276,741.16.
Shares of stock originally transferred to the trusts had a value of $90,600.
The difference of $186,141.16 represented the value of accumulated income and stock purchased for the trust with such income.
The Commissioner included the total amount of $276,741.16 in Fabrice's gross estate, on the ground that Fabrice's power to distribute or accumulate the income of the trusts constituted a power to designate the persons who would possess or enjoy the income and to alter the trusts, within the meaning of 811(c) (1) (B) (ii) and 811(d) (1) of the 1939 Code.
The district court determined that the aforesaid parts of the 1939 Code were applicable, but held that the amount includible in the gross estate was only the value of the stock originally transferred by Fabrice to the trusts ($90,600) and did not include accumulated income and property purchased with accumulated income ($186,141.16).
It relied on our decision in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. McDermott's Estate , 7 Cir., 222 F.2d 665 , 55 A.L.R.2d 410 (1955).
1 The parties in this case agree that the judgment entered by the district court conforms with our holding in McDermott's Estate.
However, defendant asks us to reject McDermott's Estate on the authority of Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co. , 278 U.S. 339, 345 , 49 S.Ct. 123 , 73 L.Ed. 410 ; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Estate of Church , 335 U.S. 632, 644-646 , 69 S.Ct. 322 , 93 L.Ed. 288 , and other cases.
After citing our holding in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Gidwitz' Estate , 7 Cir., 196 F.2d 813 , we said, in McDermott's Estate , 222 F.2d at 667-668 : Section 811(c) (1) Section 811(d) (1) We discern that Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Estate of Church is not inconsistent with McDermott's Estate.
Church created an irrevocable trust but required the trustees to pay him the income for life and, under those facts, the Supreme Court held the transfer incomplete until Church's death.
In the case at bar, Fabrice had no right to receive the income or corpus during his lifetime or at his death.
Nor is Reinecke applicable, because the trusts in that case were revocable .
Industrial Trust Co. v. Commissioner , 1 Cir., 165 F.2d 142 , 1 A.L.R.2d 144 (1947) and other cases relied on by defendant are not inconsistent with the disposition which we make of this appeal.
The one exception seems to be Estate of Round v. Commissioner , 40 T.C. 970 , where the decision does not cite McDermott's Estate or the Tax Court's contrary decision in McDermott's Estate, 12 TCM 481, 489, or its contrary dictum in McGehee v. Commissioner , 28 T.C. 412 .
These latter decisions cast some doubt upon the authority of Round, which was affirmed, 1 Cir., 332 F.2d 590 (1964), in an opinion in which the court admitted, at 595, that it was unable to agree with the Seventh Circuit.
On the other hand, McDermott's Estate was approved and followed in Michigan Trust Company v. Kavanagh , 6 Cir., 284 F.2d 502 (1960).
Although McDermott's Estate was decided in 1955 and the rule stated therein has never been changed by any act of Congress, we believe that it is firmly established as the law of this circuit.
Under the doctrine of stare decisis , even if we had any doubt as to the correctness of our holding in McDermott's Estate, we would not be justified, because of any of the arguments advanced by defendant, in reversing that holding at this time.
In California State Board of Equalization v. Goggin , 9 Cir., 245 F.2d 44 , at 45 (1957), cert. den.
353 U.S. 961 , 77 S.Ct. 863 , 1 L.Ed.2d 910 the court remarked: In Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Moran , 8 Cir., 236 F.2d 595 , at 596 (1956), the court said: Birmingham v. Geer 185 F.2d 82, 85 340 U.S. 951 71 S.Ct. 571 95 L.Ed. 686 Avalon Amusement Corp. v. United States 165 F.2d 653 United States v. Armature Rewinding Co. 124 F.2d 589, 591 United States v. Kelley 110 F.2d 922, 924 Grain Belt Supply Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue 109 F.2d 490, 492 Lazier v. United States 170 F.2d 521, 526 9 A.L.R.2d 324 For the reasons which we have herein stated, the judgment from which defendant has appealed is affirmed.
Judgment affirmed.
