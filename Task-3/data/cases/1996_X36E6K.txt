 JAMES R. BROWNING , Circuit Judge: Plaintiffs Karen Finley, John Fleck, Holly Hughes, and Tim Miller were refused fellowships under the defendant National Endowment for the Arts' ("NEA") solo performance artists program.
They filed suit, alleging, among other things, that a provision of the NEA's governing statute identifying the standard for approval of funding applications violated the Fifth and First Amendments because it was impermissibly vague and imposed content-based restrictions on protected speech.
The district court agreed, granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs, and certified its ruling for interlocutory appeal.
Finley v. National Endowment for the Arts , 795 F.Supp.
1457 (C.D.Cal.1992).
We affirm, essentially for the reasons stated by the district court.
1 Congress gave the NEA authority "to establish and carry out a program of grants-in-aid to individuals of exceptional talent engaged in or concerned with the arts."
20 U.S.C. 954(c) .
The Chairperson of the NEA has ultimate authority to approve or disapprove grants.
20 U.S.C. 954(c) , 955(f) .
Before making a decision on a particular grant application, however, the Chairperson must consult and receive the advice of the 26-member National Council on the Arts.
2 20 U.S.C. 955(f) .
The Chairperson may not approve any application disapproved by the National Council.
Id .
The Chairperson must also utilize advisory panels to review applications and make recommendations to the National Council.
20 U.S.C. 959(c) .
An advisory panel recommended approval of plaintiffs' applications; a majority of the Council recommended disapproval; the Chairperson denied the applications.
The district court concluded the statutory standard under which the applications were judged, which requires the NEA to "tak[e] into consideration general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public," 20 U.S.C. 954(d)(1) , violated plaintiffs' due process and free speech rights.

The void-for-vagueness doctrine incorporates several important due process principles.
4 It requires that a law give fair notice of its mandate.
"[B]ecause we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly."
Grayned v. City of Rockford , 408 U.S. 104, 108 , 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2298 , 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972).
The void-for-vagueness doctrine also requires that a law provide explicit standards for those who are to apply it.
"A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application."
Id. at 108-09 , 92 S.Ct. at 2299 .
The twin dangers of a vague law--lack of notice and arbitrary or discriminatory application--may chill the exercise of important constitutional rights.
"[W]here a vague statute 'abut[s] upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms,' it 'operates to inhibit the exercise of [those] freedoms.'"
Id. at 109 , 92 S.Ct. at 2299 (citation omitted).
Not surprisingly, therefore, courts apply a heightened vagueness standard to a law that could deter protected speech because of its uncertain meaning.
N.A.A.C.P.
v. Button , 371 U.S. 415, 432-33 , 83 S.Ct. 328, 337-38 , 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963) ("[S]tandards of permissible statutory vagueness are strict in the area of free expression Because First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive, government may regulate in the area only with narrow specificity.").
5 A .
NEA's primary contention is that the vagueness of the "decency and respect" provision is not an issue.
In its view, Congress did not compel NEA to add this element to the standard for judging grant applications, and the NEA elected not to add it.
The standard therefore remains as it was before the amendment: the sole criteria for judging grant applications are "artistic excellence and artistic merit."
NEA reads the "decency and respect" amendment as requiring only that the Chairperson " tak[e] into consideration general standards of decency and respect for diverse beliefs and values" when promulgating regulations and procedures for judging grant applications.
20 U.S.C. 954(d)(1) (emphasis added).
According to NEA, the Chairperson did address Congress's concern that decency and respect for diverse beliefs and values be considered in funding decisions, and concluded no change in the regulations was necessary because the NEA's governing statute requires advisory panels with diversified membership to review applications and make recommendations to the National Council.
6 The Chairperson reasoned that because advisory panels were composed of members chosen to reflect a wide range of backgrounds and points of view, the decisions of these panels as to the artistic excellence and merit of individual applications would necessarily reflect general standards of decency and show respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public.
This interpretation reads 954(d) as if it had not been amended.
Congress added the clause at issue--"taking into consideration general standards of decency and respect"--immediately after the clause specifying the criteria by which applications are to be judged--"artistic excellence and artistic merit."
Read together, these clauses instruct the Chairperson to ensure that standards of decency and respect for diverse values are considered when judging the artistic merit and excellence of an application.
Congress spoke in mandatory terms when it amended the criteria for judging grant applications: "the Chairperson shall ensure that artistic excellence and artistic merit are the criteria by which applications are judged, taking into consideration general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public."
20 U.S.C. 954(d) (emphasis added).
This language does not grant the Chairperson broad discretion in establishing criteria for judging grant applications, as NEA contends; it actually restricts the Chairperson's discretion by requiring him or her to judge applications according to standards of "decency and respect."
7 NEA's reading of 954(d)(1) is also contrary to traditional canons of statutory construction.
If 954(d)(1) required nothing more than diverse advisory panels, the "decency and respect" provision would be redundant in view of 959(c) , also adopted as part of the 1990 amendments, which expressly requires that advisory panels reflect diversity.
8 See Freytag v. Commissioner , 501 U.S. 868, 877 , 111 S.Ct. 2631, 2638 , 115 L.Ed.2d 764 (1991) ("Our cases consistently have expressed 'a deep reluctance to interpret a statutory provision so as to render superfluous other provisions in the same enactment.'")
(citation omitted).
9 And turning to the legislative history, as we do to interpret an ambiguously worded statute, makes it clear that Congress intended to change the standard NEA applied in judging applications for funding, not simply to ask the NEA to consider the problem.
NEA had been attacked for funding controversial artists and art works.
Criticism had focused on a series of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe objected to as homoerotic images, and on a photograph by Andres Serrano criticized as blasphemous.
The "decency and respect" provision was enacted in direct response to this controversy and was specifically designed to prevent the funding of similar art works.
Members of Congress noted that the "decency and respect" provision would prevent the funding of similar works in the future.
10 136 Cong.Rec.
H9410 -57 (Oct. 11, 1990).
In the words of Representative Henry, author of the provision: "[T]his substitute includes language in the heart of the grant making process.
We add to the criteria of artistic excellence and artistic merit, a shell, a screen, a viewpoint that must be constantly taken into account on behalf o[f] the American public " 136 Cong.Rec.
H9417 (Oct. 11, 1990).
Representative Henry described the provision as "new language now in the grant procedure itself which mandates that in the awarding of funds, in the award process itself, general standards of decency must be accorded."
136 Cong. Rec.
H9457 (Oct. 11, 1990).
In the same vein, Representative Coleman, cosponsor of the bill, said: "[W]e have added language which underscores that the decisions of artistic excellence must take into consideration general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public.
Works which deeply offend the sensibilities of significant portions of the public ought not to be supported with public funds."
136 Cong.Rec.
H9410 (Oct. 11, 1990).
In concluding that Congress intended to include the criteria of "decency and respect" in the standard for judging grant applications, we reject NEA's contention that 954(d)(1) is to be read as a compromise between legislators who wanted to impose explicit content restrictions upon funding and those who wanted to impose no "decency and respect" restriction at all, and agreed simply to identify "decency and respect" as an area of concern but require no further action by NEA.
No proposal submitted to Congress would have permitted funding with no content restriction at all.
The dispute was not over whether NEA should be free to fund indecent or disrespectful art, but over the way in which the new limitation would be imposed: whether Congress should specify categories of art that could not be funded or instruct NEA to consider general standards of "decency and respect" in judging the artistic merit of a grant application.
Congress settled on the latter approach.
We also reject NEA's argument that Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. , 467 U.S. 837 , 104 S.Ct. 2778 , 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), requires deference to NEA's construction of its statutory mandate.
NEA's construction of the statute as permitting the Chairperson to rely upon greater diversity in advisory panel membership in lieu of a change in the criteria for judging grant applications is not a "permissible" or "reasonable" one to which deference is required.
Id. at 843-45 , 104 S.Ct. at 2782-83 .
Moreover, NEA itself did not in practice adopt the interpretation of the "decency and respect" provision it advocates in this litigation.
In a meeting held on December 14 and 15, 1990, the Chairperson and National Council considered a number of proposals to implement the "decency and respect" provision.
They did not question their obligation under 954(d)(1) to judge grant applications according to "general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public."
Instead, to satisfy this new obligation, NEA officials adopted the approach of having the Chairperson instruct advisory panel members to bring their own definitions of these terms "to the table" and make them "part of the deliberative process."

B .
NEA contends that even if 954(d)(1) requires it to judge grant applications according to general standards of decency and respect, the Chairperson could by regulation implement this standard in a way that would obviate the vagueness problem.
However, the NEA has failed to present a narrowing construction that is consistent with the language and purpose of the statute, and "we will not rewrite a law to conform it to constitutional requirements."
Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n.
, 484 U.S. 383, 397 , 108 S.Ct. 636, 645 , 98 L.Ed.2d 782 (1988); see also Heckler v. Mathews , 465 U.S. 728, 741 , 104 S.Ct. 1387, 1396 , 79 L.Ed.2d 646 (1984) ("The canon favoring constructions of statutes to avoid constitutional questions does not license a court to usurp the policymaking and legislative functions of duly elected representatives.").
NEA suggests the Chairperson could apply 954(d)(1) by rejecting applications for funding of projects that are obscene under the standard announced in Miller v. California , 413 U.S. 15, 24-25 , 93 S.Ct. 2607, 2614-16 , 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973)--a standard that passed the vagueness test in Hamling v. United States , 418 U.S. 87, 110-16 , 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2904-07 , 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974).
However, the proposed construction would render redundant a separate prohibition against funding projects determined to be obscene, subsection (2) of section 954(d) .
11 See Freytag , 501 U.S. at 877 , 111 S.Ct. at 2638 .
Congress adopted the "decency and respect" provision because it was broader and had a different meaning than the provision prohibiting the funding of obscene art.
12 Moreover, the NEA's proposed construction would be contrary to the express intent of Congress that determinations of obscenity be made by the courts and not by NEA.
13 NEA also seems to suggest the Chairperson might avoid the vagueness problem by adopting the definition of "indecent communication" promulgated by the Federal Communication Commission and applying the standard only to works intended for children.
14 This construction is precluded by Congress's explicit refusal to include the FCC's definition of indecency in 954(d)(1) .
15 Congress considered the definition inappropriate for the arts, even if appropriate for broadcasting.
16 Moreover, unlike the statute implemented by the FCC's regulation, 954(d)(1) is not aimed solely at indecent speech harmful to minors, but requires the NEA to judge all grant applications according to both "general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public."
20 U.S.C. 954(d)(1) (emphasis added).
Nothing in 954(d)(1) or its legislative history suggests the NEA may choose to apply the "decency and respect" provision to some funding applications and not to others or that it may ignore the "respect" criterion when it does apply the provision.
C .
NEA and the dissent argue the "decency and respect" provision is not subject to a vagueness challenge because it does not regulate conduct directly but merely subsidizes speech.
Although the need for fair warning may be less when a statute does not directly regulate conduct, the need for specific standards to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory application of provisions that touch upon speech may be even greater when a statute subsidizes speech and the risk that the provision on its face will inhibit speech remains.
See Grayned , 408 U.S. at 108 , 92 S.Ct. at 2298 ; Bullfrog Films, Inc. v. Wick , 847 F.2d 502, 514 (9th Cir.1988) (holding void for vagueness a regulatory provision exempting from import duties certain types of written materials); Big Mama Rag, Inc. v. United States , 631 F.2d 1030, 1039 (D.C.Cir.1980) (holding void for vagueness a tax exemption for educational and charitable organizations).
17 NEA also argues that the decency provision is not subject to a vagueness challenge because it merely directs the Chairperson to promulgate regulations and establish procedures to govern applications for funding; such regulations and procedures may be subject to the void-for-vagueness test, but the direction to the Chairperson to establish them is not.
This argument rests on the interpretation of 954(d)(1) rejected earlier.
Section 954(d)(1) is not a broad grant of regulatory authority which the Chairperson may implement in a discretionary manner, but a directive to the NEA to judge grant applications according to standards of "decency and respect."
The "decency and respect" provision was enacted to prevent the funding of particular types of art.
To that end, it places a mandatory duty on the Chairperson to ensure that grant applications are judged according to "general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public."
The Chairperson has no discretion to ignore this obligation, enforce only part of it, or give it a cramped construction.
Rather, the Chairperson, Council, and advisory panels must examine each grant application to determine if it comports with "general standards of decency" and shows "respect for diverse beliefs and values" as they subjectively understand these terms.
The record indicates this is exactly how the Chairperson and Council interpreted the provision prior to this litigation.
So construed, the "decency and respect" provision violates due process because "no standard of conduct is specified at all," Coates v. City of Cincinnati , 402 U.S. 611, 614 , 91 S.Ct. 1686, 1688 , 29 L.Ed.2d 214 (1971), and the statute thus provides no "ascertainable standard for inclusion and exclusion."
Smith v. Goguen , 415 U.S. 566, 578 , 94 S.Ct. 1242, 1249 , 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974).
Without doubt, persons "of common intelligence must necessarily guess at [the] meaning and differ as to [the] application" of the terms "decency" and "respect."
See Connally v. General Constr. Co. , 269 U.S. 385, 391 , 46 S.Ct. 126, 127 , 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926).
These terms are inherently ambiguous, varying in meaning from individual to individual.
See Smith , 415 U.S. at 573 , 94 S.Ct. at 1247 ("[W]hat is contemptuous to one may be a work of art to another.
"); Coates , 402 U.S. at 614 , 91 S.Ct. at 1688 ("Conduct that annoys some people does not annoy others.
"); Cohen v. California , 403 U.S. 15, 25 , 91 S.Ct. 1780, 1788 , 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971) ("[O]ne['s] vulgarity is another's lyric.").
The content of the term "diverse beliefs and values of the American public" is also impossible to define.
The individual members of a pluralistic society, and particularly our own, have a great variety of beliefs and values, largely unascertainable.
See Bullfrog Films , 847 F.2d at 513 .
Since it is not susceptible to objective definition, the "decency and respect" standard gives rise to the danger of arbitrary and discriminatory application.
18 It grants government officials power to deny an application for funding if the application offends the officials' subjective beliefs and values.
Inevitably, NEA's decision not to fund a particular artist or project as indecent or disrespectful will depend in part on who is judging the application and whether that official agrees with the artist's point of view.
Under such a grant of authority, funding may be refused because of the artist's political or social message or because the art or the artist is too controversial.
This danger is especially pronounced because a vague statute effectively shields decisions from review.
Where First Amendment liberties are at stake, such a grant of authority violates fundamental principles of due process.
II .
Our holding that 954(d)(1) is unconstitutionally vague effectively disposes of this case.
However, in view of the dissent's argument that the government may restrict the content of speech it funds, we briefly explain why the First Amendment's 19 prohibition on content and viewpoint-based restrictions provides an alternate ground for our decision.
"It is axiomatic" that under the First Amendment, "the government may not regulate speech based on its substantive content or the message it conveys."
Rosenberger , U.S. at , 115 S.Ct. at 2516 ; see also Action for Children's Television v. F.C.C.
, 58 F.3d 654, 659 (D.C.Cir.1995).
A content-based restriction on speech is therefore presumed unconstitutional, Rosenberger , U.S. at , 115 S.Ct. at 2516 , and must be subjected to "'the most exacting scrutiny.'"
Texas v. Johnson , 491 U.S. 397, 412 , 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2544 , 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989) ( quoting Boos v. Barry , 485 U.S. 312, 321 , 108 S.Ct. 1157, 1164 , 99 L.Ed.2d 333 (1988)).
To survive this scrutiny, the government must advance a compelling interest served by its regulation of the content of protected speech, and the regulation must be narrowly tailored to serve that interest.
Sable Communications v. F.C.C.
, 492 U.S. 115, 126 , 109 S.Ct. 2829, 2836 , 106 L.Ed.2d 93 (1989); Denver Area Educ. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. F.C.C.
, U.S. , , 116 S.Ct. 2374, 2385 , 135 L.Ed.2d 888 (1996) (government may directly regulate speech "to address extraordinary problems, where its regulations are appropriately tailored to resolve those problems without imposing an unnecessarily great restriction on speech"); Action for Children's Television , 58 F.3d at 659 .
The presence of government funding alters this framework somewhat.
The government may make content-based choices "when it is the speaker or when it enlists private entities to convey its own message."
Rosenberger , U.S. at , 115 S.Ct. at 2518 .
Thus, the Supreme Court has upheld regulations that granted tax deductions for veterans' groups but not for other charitable groups engaged in lobbying, see Regan v. Taxation With Representation , 461 U.S. 540, 545-48 , 103 S.Ct. 1997, 2000-02 , 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983), and barred recipients of federal family planning funds from providing information on abortion.
Rust v. Sullivan , 500 U.S. 173, 200 , 111 S.Ct. 1759, 1776 , 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991).
As the Court explained in Rust , "when the government appropriates public funds to establish a program it is entitled to define the limits of that program."
Id. at 194 , 111 S.Ct. at 1773 .
Government funding does not invariably justify government control of the content of speech, however.
In Rust , the Court cautioned that its holding would not apply to public fora or to universities, which occupied "a traditional sphere of free expression so fundamental to the functioning of our society that the Government's ability to control speech within that sphere by means of conditions attached to the expenditure of Government funds is restricted."
Rust , 500 U.S. at 200 , 111 S.Ct. at 1776 .
In addition, Rust and Rosenberger identify two related contexts in which the government may subsidize speech only if it does so in a way that is viewpoint-neutral.
Neutrality may be required because the area is a "traditional sphere of free expression," Rust , 500 U.S. at 200 , or because the government has declared its intention to "encourage a diversity of views from private speakers."
Rosenberger , U.S. at , 115 S.Ct. at 2519 .
Both approaches support the district court's conclusion that government funding of the arts, in the circumstances of this case, must be viewpoint-neutral.
As the district court explained, the arts, no less than the university, are "at the core of a democratic society's cultural and political vitality," Finley , 795 F.Supp.
at 1473 .
The district court's analysis is full and cogent, and we need not repeat it here.
20 Similarly, Congress has clearly indicated the NEA's purpose is to support a diverse array of artistic expression.
Even the most cursory review of the NEA's enabling statute reveals this intent.
In its findings, Congress emphasized that a democracy must "honor and preserve its multi-cultural artistic heritage as well as support new ideas" and declared its intent "to help create and sustain a climate encouraging freedom of thought, imagination, and inquiry."
20 U.S.C. 951(10) , (7).
The Senate Report accompanying the legislation emphasized that "freedom of artistic and humanistic expression" was to be given "the fullest attention" and that "[c]onformity for its own sake is not to be encouraged, and no undue preference should be given to any particular style or school of thought or expression."
See S.Rep.
No. 300, 89th Cong., 1st Sess.
4 (1965).
The House reaffirmed this view in adopting the 1985 amendments to the NEA's governing legislation, urging NEA to be "more responsive to funding programs that represent the many traditions in our heritage and the full cultural diversity of our citizens [T]he [funded] programs should be open and richly diverse, reflecting the ferment of ideas which has always made this Nation strong and free."
H.R.Rep.
No. 274, 99th Cong., 1st Sess.
13, reprinted in 1985 U.S.C.C.A.N.
1055, 1058.
The NEA and it programs were created to encourage diverse private speech and not, as the dissent suggests, to engage in "speech for hire."
The First Amendment prohibits the government from "regulating speech when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction."
Rosenberger , U.S. at , 115 S.Ct. at 2516 ( citing Perry Educ.
Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n , 460 U.S. 37, 46 , 103 S.Ct. 948, 955 , 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983)); see Johnson , 491 U.S. at 414 , 109 S.Ct. at 2545 ("If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.").
Even when the government is funding speech, it may not distinguish between speakers on the basis of the speaker's viewpoint or otherwise "ai[m] at the suppression of dangerous ideas."
Regan , 461 U.S. at 548 , 103 S.Ct. at 2002 ( quoting Cammarano v. United States , 358 U.S. 498, 513 , 79 S.Ct. 524, 533 , 3 L.Ed.2d 462 (1959)); see Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc. , 327 U.S. 146, 158-59 , 66 S.Ct. 456, 462-63 , 90 L.Ed. 586 (1946).
Therefore, we cannot agree with NEA's assertion that the "decency and respect" provision does not reflect viewpoint discrimination.
21 In Rosenberger , the Supreme Court found viewpoint discrimination in a university regulation that "select[ed] for disfavored treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints."
U.S. at , 115 S.Ct. at 2517 .
Central to the court's decision was the fact that under the regulation, any topic treated from a religious perspective would be denied funding.
See id. ("Religion provides a specific premise, a perspective, a standpoint from which a variety of subjects may be discussed and considered.
The prohibited perspective, not the general subject matter, resulted in the refusal to make third-party payments.").
Here too, it is the treatment of a subject, not the subject itself, that is disfavored.
Two depictions of the same subject matter--an American flag, for example--could be treated differently if NEA believed one depiction symbolized an "indecent" perspective or demonstrated disrespect for "the diverse beliefs and values of the American public," and the other did not.
The dissent argues we have erred in applying the body of law for regulation of speech and generally available entitlements to prizes.
According to the dissent, since the NEA grants are a prize given to a select few, rather than a generally available benefit, the government can choose to support only a certain viewpoint.
The Supreme Court explicitly rejected a similar argument by the University in Rosenberger .
As the Court explained, "[t]he government cannot justify viewpoint discrimination among private speakers on the economic fact of scarcity."
U.S. at , 115 S.Ct. at 2519 .
Although NEA awarded only 88 grants from an applicant pool of 5,168, it cannot provide those scarce grants to favor a particular viewpoint.
See id. at , 115 S.Ct. at 2519-20 (rejecting the University's argument that "scarcity would give the State the right to exercise viewpoint discrimination that is otherwise impermissible").
NEA contends the "decency and respect" provision is permissible because it can be implemented in a viewpoint and content-neutral way.
22 As we have explained, however, 954(d)(1) on its face requires NEA to take "decency" and "respect" into account in considering grant applications.
Like the funding restriction at issue in Rosenberger , the "decency and respect" provision clearly focuses on the content of the speech at issue; it "has a speech-based restriction as its sole rationale and operative principle."
Rosenberger , U.S. at , 115 S.Ct. at 2519 .
The "decency and respect" provision authorizes viewpoint discrimination, an "egregious form of content discrimination."
Rosenberger , U.S. at , 115 S.Ct. at 2516 .
Because the government has made no attempt to articulate a compelling interest served by the provision, 23 954(d)(1) cannot survive strict scrutiny.
24 III .
The "decency and respect" provision of 954(d)(1) is void for vagueness under the Fifth Amendment, and impermissibly restricts plaintiffs' First Amendment rights as well.
AFFIRMED .
