 PER CURIAM.
Appellee has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the order appealed from is not a final and appealable order.
We agree.
The appeal, instead of being from the final judgment entered against appellant on January 30, 1950, is from the order denying a motion to set that final judgment aside.
It is settled law that such an order is not appealable.
Cf. Cromelin v. Markwalter , 5 Cir., 181 F.2d 948 ; French v. Jeffries , 7 Cir., 161 F.2d 97 ; U. S. v. Muschany , 8 Cir., 156 F.2d 196 .
The appeal is Dismissed.
