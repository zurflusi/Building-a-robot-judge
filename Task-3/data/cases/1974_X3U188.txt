 KOELSCH , Circuit Judge: This matter has a long history.
In 1961 plaintiff-appellant Imbler was convicted on a murder charge in Los Angeles Superior Court and sentenced to death.
The California Supreme Court affirmed.
People v. Imbler , 57 Cal.2d 711 , 21 Cal.Rptr.
568 , 371 P.2d 304 (1962).
Thereafter, Imbler's state habeas corpus petition was denied following an evidentiary hearing.
In re Imbler , 60 Cal.2d 554 , 35 Cal.Rptr.
293 , 387 P.2d 6 (1963).
A subsequent writ set aside the death penalty, In re Imbler , 61 Cal.2d 556 , 39 Cal.Rptr.
375 , 393 P.2d 687 (1964); and when the state declined to prosecute another "penalty trial," Imbler was given a life sentence.
In 1969 the United States District Court, concluding that Imbler's conviction was secured in part by testimony the prosecution knew, or had strong reason to know, was perjured, granted him a writ of habeas corpus.
Imbler v. Craven , 298 F.Supp.
795, 809 (1969).
We affirmed, Imbler v. Craven , 424 F.2d 631 (9th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 865 , 91 S.Ct. 100 , 27 L.Ed.2d 104 .
Imbler then brought this suit for damages.
So far as need be noticed, his allegations in substance are that the defendant Pachtman, the district attorney who prosecuted the criminal charges on behalf of the State of California, had knowingly, maliciously, etc., used perjured testimony to secure a conviction and hence was liable in damages for violation of his, Imbler's, civil right's.
The district judge dismissed Imbler's complaint as to Pachtman without leave to amend; he ruled that Pachtman, as a prosecuting attorney, enjoyed an immunity from suit for acts committed "in the performance of duties constituting an integral part of the judicial process .

", Marlowe v. Coakley , 404 F.2d 70 (9th Cir. 1968); see Robichaud v. Ronan , 351 F.2d 533 (9th Cir. 1965); and that as a matter of law the acts complained of came within a quasi-judicial prosecutorial function to which immunity attached.
Imbler appeals.
1 We affirm.
The district court's dismissal of appellant's claim was consistent with our prior decisions.
Ney v. State of California , 439 F.2d 1285 (9th Cir. 1971); Donovan v. Reinbold , 433 F.2d 738, 743 (9th Cir. 1970); Marlowe v. Coakley , supra ; Clark v. Washington , 366 F.2d 678 (9th Cir. 1966); Robichaud v. Ronan , supra ; Agnew v. Moody , 330 F.2d 868 (9th Cir. 1964); Harmon v. Superior Court , 329 F.2d 154 (9th Cir. 1964); Sires v. Cole , 320 F.2d 877 (9th Cir. 1963).
The acts of the defendant which allegedly harmed appellant occurred during prosecutorial activities which can only be characterized as an "integral part of the judicial process."
2 All involved the questioning of a witness during the 1961 criminal prosecution.
3 Appellant, in effect, urges us to reject the doctrine of prosecutorial immunity and overrule a long line of this court's decisions.
We decline to do so. The protection given a prosecutor acting in his quasi-judicial role protects not simply the prosecutor, but, more importantly, the effective operation of the judicial process, and hence the "common good."
Because both the honest and dishonest are insulated, on occasion an injury without redress inevitably results; but, as well expressed by Judge Learned Hand: Gregoire v. Biddle 177 F.2d 579 As indicated earlier, the issue is not " res nova " in this circuit.
4 The "balance between the evils inevitable in either alternative" has consistently been struck in favor of protecting honest criminal prosecution, at the expense of those injured by scoundrels, 5 by granting immunity from suit to all prosecutors.
6 The judgment is affirmed.
