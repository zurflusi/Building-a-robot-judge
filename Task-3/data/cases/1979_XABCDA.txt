 CELEBREZZE , Circuit Judge.
Petitioner-appellant, Richard Earl Pilon, was convicted in a Kentucky Circuit Court jury trial of manslaughter in the first degree.
His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the Supreme Court of Kentucky.
Pilon v. Commonwealth , 544 S.W.2d 228 (Ky.1976).
He appeals from the district court's denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
The principal contention on appeal is that the refusal of the state trial court to give a lesser included offense jury instruction constituted a denial of due process.
1 We affirm.
We adopt the recitation of facts given by the Supreme Court of Kentucky: 544 S.W.2d at 229-30 Pilon argues that the state trial court's refusal to give a requested lesser included offense instruction constituted a denial of due process.
Pilon was found guilty of the offense charged in the indictment, viz.
, manslaughter in the first degree.
K. R.S.
507.030 .
2 He requested that the jury be instructed that it could convict him of the lesser included offense of reckless homicide.
K. R.S.
507.050 .
3 The trial court's refusal to so instruct was upheld by the Supreme Court of Kentucky.
It reasoned that there was "no evidence in this record which would justify the giving of a reckless-homicide instruction."
544 S.W.2d at 231 .
We agree.
Reckless homicide occurs under Kentucky law "when, with recklessness [a person] causes the death of another person."
K. R.S.
507.050(1) .
"Recklessly," in turn, is defined as follows: R.S.
501.020(4) Under the state's theory of the case, Pilon did not act "recklessly," as defined above.
Rather, the state contended, and its evidence supported this contention, that Pilon inflicted a severe beating upon the victim and committed manslaughter in the first degree since, "with intent to cause serious physical injury to [the victim], he cause[d] the death of such person . "
K. R.S.
507.030(1)(a) .
Thus, the jury only needed to decide if Pilon committed such an act.
Reckless homicide was not an alternative under this view of the evidence since Pilon was alleged to have intentionally caused the injuries leading to the death, as opposed to failing to perceive a substantial risk of death.
The evidence could have supported only one other theory which could have led the jury to believe Pilon was criminally responsible for the victim's death yet not guilty of manslaughter in the first degree.
The jury might have found that Pilon did not beat the victim but acted culpably in not taking the victim to the hospital after Dr. Kincaid recommended that Pilon do so.
This would not have constituted reckless homicide, however, since the advice of Dr. Kincaid would have made Pilon aware of the risk to the victim if not taken to the hospital.
Reckless homicide is defined to occur when one " fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk" of death.
K. R.S.
507.050(1) ; 501.020(4) (emphasis added).
Thus, the only alternative theory of guilt besides the offense charged which the evidence would support was not consistent with reckless homicide and the trial court did not err in refusing to give a reckless homicide instruction.
So even if we assume that the failure to give a requested lesser included offense instruction could ever be cognizable in a habeas corpus proceeding, such failure clearly does not rise to the level of constitutional error when the failure was correct as a matter of state law. 4 See Weston v. Rose , 527 F.2d 524 (6th Cir. 1975) (no federal constitutional error cognizable on habeas in giving jury instruction later declared erroneous by state supreme court).
5 While the alternative theory of guilt outlined above would not support a reckless homicide charge, it may well have supported an instruction on manslaughter in the second degree.
That crime is defined in Kentucky to occur when one "wantonly causes the death of another person."
K. R.S.
507.040(1) .
6 "Wantonly," in turn, is defined as follows: R.S.
501.020(3) If the jury believed that Pilon caused the death of the victim not by beating him but by failing to take him to the hospital when so advised by Dr. Kincaid, that could constitute manslaughter in the second degree since Pilon would have been "aware of and consciously disregard[ed] a substantial and unjustifiable risk" of death.
K. R.S.
507.040(1) ; 501.020(3).
Pilon did not request an instruction on the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree, however.
As a general rule, the failure to give an unrequested lesser included offense instruction is not cognizable on habeas corpus.
