 SOTOMAYOR, Circuit Judge.
Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc. ("Empire") appeals from a judgment entered in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Cote, J.) dismissing for lack of subject matter jurisdiction Empire's contract action against Denise McVeigh, as administratrix of Joseph McVeigh's estate, for reimbursement of insurance benefits.
Because the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act, 5 U.S.C. 8901 8914 , does not affirmatively authorize the creation of federal common law in this case, federal common-law rule-making is only appropriate if the operation of state law would "'significant[ly] conflict'" with "uniquely federal interest[s]."

Corp. , 487 U.S. 500, 507, 508 , 108 S.Ct. 2510 , 101 L.Ed.2d 442 (1988).
Because no such conflict has been demonstrated in this dispute, Empire's action arises under state, not federal, law.
Accordingly, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
See 28 U.S.C. 1331 ; Empire HealthChoice Assurance v. McVeigh , No. 03 Civ. 2728 , 2003 WL 22171693 (S.D.N.Y.
Sept.18, 2003).
BACKGROUND The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act ("FEHBA") charges the United States Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") with negotiating and regulating health benefits plans for federal employees.
See 5 U.S.C. 8902(a) .
Pursuant to FEHBA, OPM entered into a contract in 1960 with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association ("BCBSA") to establish a nationwide fee-for-service health plan (the "Plan"), the terms of which are renegotiated annually.
1 Plaintiff-appellant Empire is the entity that administers the Plan to federal employees in New York State.
Defendant-Appellee Denise Finn McVeigh ("McVeigh") administers the estate of Joseph E. McVeigh ("Decedent"), a former enrollee in the Plan.
The Decedent suffered injuries in an accident in 1997 and received $157,309.06 in benefits from the Plan between 1997 and 2001, the year of his death.
McVeigh subsequently brought state tort actions on behalf of herself, the Decedent and a minor child against the parties who had allegedly caused Decedent's injuries.
McVeigh received $3,175,000 when the lawsuit settled in 2003.
Prior to the entry of the settlement, Empire became aware of the agreement and notified McVeigh that it had a lien on the Decedent's share of the settlement for $157,309.06.
McVeigh agreed to place $100,000 of the Decedent's share of the settlement funds into escrow pending resolution of Empire's claims.
On April 18, 2003, Empire filed suit against McVeigh for $157,309.06 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
The complaint was based on a subrogation and reimbursement provision contained in the Statement of Benefits of the Plan.
Under this provision, an enrollee who receives benefits in connection with an injury in addition to compensation from a third party must reimburse the Plan the amount of benefits paid.
2 Empire's complaint alleged that McVeigh breached this provision and sought a judgment declaring that pursuant to the Plan, FEHBA, its regulations and federal common law, Empire was entitled to reimbursement from McVeigh for the amount of benefits paid for Decedent's injuries.
McVeigh moved for dismissal of the action on the grounds that, inter alia , the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.
In response, Empire claimed that the court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1331 because federal common law governed its reimbursement claim.
In the alternative, Empire argued that the Plan itself constituted federal law.
District Court Judge Denise Cote rejected both of Empire's theories and granted McVeigh's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on September 18, 2003.
See Empire HealthChoice Assur.
, 2003 WL 22171693 , at *3-*5.
DISCUSSION A. We review de novo a district court's legal conclusions with respect to its subject matter jurisdiction.
Gualandi v. Adams , 385 F.3d 236, 240 (2d Cir.2004).
Empire claims that federal jurisdiction exists pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1331 , which grants federal district courts original jurisdiction over "all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States."
Section 1331 jurisdiction—that is, federal question jurisdiction—"exists where a well-pleaded complaint 'establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff's right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.'"
Greenberg v. Bear, Stearns & Co. , 220 F.3d 22, 25 (2d.
Cir.2000) (quoting Franchise Tax Bd. v. Const.
Laborers Vacation Trust , 463 U.S. 1, 27-28 , 103 S.Ct. 2841 , 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983)); see also Marcus v. AT & T Corp. , 138 F.3d 46, 52 (2d Cir.1998).
Though the plaintiff is generally "the master of the complaint," id. , a plaintiff cannot create federal jurisdiction under 1331 simply by alleging a federal claim where in reality none exists.
See Perpetual Securities, Inc. v. Tang , 290 F.3d 132, 137 (2d Cir.2002).
Subject matter jurisdiction will lie only where the court determines that "'the substance of [the plaintiff's] allegations raises a federal question.'"
D'Alessio v. New York Stock Exchange, Inc. , 258 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir.2001) (emphasis omitted) (citation omitted).
The existence of a federal question must be determined solely by reference to the plaintiff's own claim—not by reference to "statements raised in anticipation or avoidance of possible defenses that may be interposed."
Briarpatch Ltd., L.P v. Phoenix Pictures, Inc. , 373 F.3d 296, 304 (2d Cir.2004); see also Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams , 482 U.S. 386, 393 , 107 S.Ct. 2425 , 96 L.Ed.2d 318 (1987).
FEHBA does not provide a federal statutory cause of action for insurance carriers to vindicate their rights under FEHBA-authorized contracts.
Thus, federal jurisdiction exists over this dispute only if federal common law governs Empire's claims.
See Woodward Governor Co. v. Curtiss-Wright Flight Sys., Inc. , 164 F.3d 123, 126 (2d Cir.1999) ("It is beyond dispute that if federal common law governs a case, that case presents a federal question within the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts, just as if the case were governed by a federal statute.").
The ability of federal courts to fashion federal common law, however, is "severely limited."
In re Gaston & Snow , 243 F.3d 599, 606 (2d Cir.2001); see also O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC , 512 U.S. 79, 87 , 114 S.Ct. 2048 , 129 L.Ed.2d 67 (1994) (stating that the "cases in which judicial creation of a special federal rule would be justified are few and restricted" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).
Absent congressional authorization, see Texas Indus. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc. , 451 U.S. 630, 641 , 101 S.Ct. 2061 , 68 L.Ed.2d 500 (1981), courts may only create federal common law where the operation of state law would (1) "'significant[ly] conflict'" with (2) "'uniquely federal interest[s],'" Boyle v. United Techs.
Corp. , 487 U.S. 500, 507, 508 , 108 S.Ct. 2510 , 101 L.Ed.2d 442 (1988) ; see also O'Melveny , 512 U.S. at 87 , 114 S.Ct. 2048 ; Woodward , 164 F.3d at 127 .
These circumstances were present, for instance, in Boyle , where the Supreme Court held that federal common law provided a defense shielding a federal defense contractor from liability under state law for defective design.
487 U.S. at 509-12 , 108 S.Ct. 2510 .
The "state-imposed duty of care," the Court found, was "precisely contrary" to a duty imposed by the government contract.
Id. at 509 , 108 S.Ct. 2510 .
Empire argues that its contract dispute with McVeigh satisfies the "uniquely federal interests" prong of Boyle .
Reimbursement, Empire explains, directly affects the United States Treasury and the cost of providing health benefits to federal employees.
Moreover, Empire contends, Congress has expressed its interest in maintaining uniformity among the states with respect to the benefits of its health plans.
We need not address these arguments, because we find that regardless of the strength or importance of the federal interests at stake, Empire has failed to demonstrate that the operation of New York state law creates "an actual, significant conflict" with those interests.
Woodward , 164 F.3d at 127 ; see also id. ("[I]n disputes between two private parties, federal courts have shown a marked reluctance to displace state law by finding a significant conflict with a federal interest.").
Tellingly, Empire's briefs on appeal fail to mention a single state law or state-imposed duty that runs contrary to the federal interests asserted in this case. Because it cannot identify any way in which the operation of state law creates an actual conflict, Empire is left to speculate about the various harms that "might" result from state-by-state adjudication of suits brought by insurance carriers under FEHBA-authorized contracts.
Empire argues, for example, that state law would undermine the federal interest in uniformity because enrollees in some states "might" successfully avoid reimbursement while others would have to repay.
Empire also contends that uncertainties associated with the application of state law "might" reduce the source of funds available to defray overall costs of paying benefits.
These speculations do not suffice to satisfy the conflict prong of Boyle .
See Woodward , 164 F.3d at 127 ("[A]n actual, significant conflict between a federal interest and state law must be specifically shown, and not generally alleged."
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).
The Fourth Circuit reached a different conclusion in Caudill v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of North Carolina, Inc. , 999 F.2d 74 (4th Cir.1993).
The Caudill court found that the application of state law "would result in a patchwork quilt of benefits that varied from state to state under the same contract because of the vast differences in the common law of contracts from state to state."
Id. at 79 .
Thus, the court held that the case presented a significant conflict between the federal interest in uniformity and state law.
Id. ("[T]he very application of state contract law would undermine the uniformity envisioned by Congress when it delegated the authority to interpret health benefit contracts to OPM.").
The Caudill court, however, cited no sources for its sweeping claim that "vast differences" existed in the common law of contracts among the states.
Id. The Supreme Court reached the opposite conclusion less than two years later in a dispute involving the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978.
See American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens , 513 U.S. 219, 233 n. 8, 115 S.Ct. 817 , 130 L.Ed.2d 715 (1995).
In Wolens , the Court observed that "[b]ecause contract law is not at its core diverse, nonuniform, and confusing," there was "no large risk of nonuniform adjudication inherent in [s]tate-court enforcement of the terms of a uniform agreement prepared by an airline and entered into with its passengers nationwide."
Id. (second alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
In light of Wolens , we see no reason to assume as a general matter that a conflict necessarily exists between the operation of state contract law and the federal interests in uniformity underlying FEHBA.
Because Empire has not demonstrated an "actual, significant" conflict between New York state law and the federal interests underlying FEHBA, see Woodward , 164 F.3d at 127 , we hold that the dispute between Empire and McVeigh fails to satisfy the conflict prong of Boyle .
B. We recognize the possibility that at a later stage in the proceedings, a significant conflict might arise between New York state law and the federal interests underlying FEHBA, such that the dispute would satisfy both prongs of Boyle .
If, for example, McVeigh were to defend herself in reliance upon a state law that was meant to advance a particular state policy, Empire could argue that such state law—whether statutory or common law—conflicts with federal interests and requires the application of federal common law.
This possibility, however, is insufficient to confer federal jurisdiction.
See Briarpatch Ltd. , 373 F.3d at 304 ("The claims established by the well-pleaded complaint must necessarily be determined from the plaintiff's statement of his or her own claim, not including statements raised in anticipation or avoidance of possible defenses that may be interposed ."
(emphasis added)); see also Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila , U.S. , 124 S.Ct. 2488, 2494 , 159 L.Ed.2d 312 (2004); City of Rome v. Verizon Communications Inc. , 362 F.3d 168, 177 (2d Cir.2004).
Thus, it would be up to the state court to apply federal common law.
See Charles Dowd Box Co., Inc. v. Courtney , 368 U.S. 502, 507-508 & n. 4, 82 S.Ct. 519 , 7 L.Ed.2d 483 (1962) (stating that state courts are competent to enforce federal rights and noting that "[i]ndeed, Congress has so arranged the limited jurisdiction of federal courts that some federal laws can be enforced only in state courts" (citations omitted)); see also Local 174, Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen & Helpers v. Lucas Flour Co. , 369 U.S. 95, 103-04 , 82 S.Ct. 571 , 7 L.Ed.2d 593 (1962) (holding that a state court exercising jurisdiction over suit arising from collective bargaining agreement must apply federal common law).
By finding that satisfaction of the two-prong Boyle test does not necessarily create federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1331 , we again part ways with the Fourth Circuit's holding in Caudill .
The Caudill court conflated the preemption and jurisdiction analyses by holding that a significant conflict with uniquely federal interests was sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the federal court.
3 See 999 F.2d at 78-79 .
We agree with the criticism Caudill has received for giving short shrift to the well-pleaded complaint rule.
See Goepel v. Nat'l Postal Mail Handlers Union , 36 F.3d 306, 314-15 (3d Cir.1994) (rejecting Caudill 's reasoning); 15 James Wm. Moore, et al., Moore's Federal Practice 103.45 [c] (3d ed.2004) (commenting that Caudill is "fatally flawed if the validity of the well-pleaded complaint rule [is] accepted").
4 C. Empire also argues—and our dissenting colleague agrees—that federal jurisdiction exists pursuant to FEHBA's preemption provision, 5 U.S.C. 8902(m)(1) .
5 Before explaining why we disagree, we discuss first a peculiar feature of 8902(m)(1) which receives very little judicial attention.
Though courts generally decide FEHBA cases as if 8902(m)(1) were a preemption provision like any other, see, e.g. , Hayes v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. , 819 F.2d 921, 926 (9th Cir.1987) (discussing earlier version of 8902(m) ); Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Fla., Inc. v. Dep't of Banking and Fin. , 791 F.2d 1501, 1504-05 (11th Cir.1986) (same), the provision is in fact quite unusual, because it provides that certain types of contract terms will "supersede and preempt" state laws in a particular field. 5 U.S.C. 8902(m)(1) .
Normally, preemption clauses provide that federal law will preempt state law.
A typical provision might provide for preemption, for example, by expressly stating that the statute's provisions preempt state law, see, e.g. , Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) 514(a) , 29 U.S.C. 1144(a) ; 1976 Copyright Act 301 , 17 U.S.C. 301(a) , or by prohibiting state law from interfering with a policy established in federal law, see, e.g. , Communications Act 253 , 47 U.S.C. 253 .
Regardless of a given provision's structure or wording, however, we generally take for granted that it is law , and not a mere contract term, that carries the preemptive force.
See generally Sprint Spectrum L.P.
v. Mills , 283 F.3d 404, 414-16 (2d Cir.2002) (summarizing preemption doctrine).
Though 8902(m)(1) 's plain language differs from typical preemption provisions by unambiguously providing for preemption by contract, such a literal reading of the provision is highly problematic, and probably unconstitutional, because only federal law may preempt state and local law.
The constitutionality of federal preemption is, after all, grounded in the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which provides that " the Laws of the United States shall be the supreme Law of the Land any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding."
U.S. Const.
Art.
VI , cl.
2 .
(emphasis added); see Sprint Spectrum , 283 F.3d at 414-15 ("The foundation of preemption doctrines is the Supremacy Clause, which invalidates state laws that interfere with, or are contrary to, federal law."
(citations, alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)).
There is no constitutional basis for making the terms of contracts with private parties similarly "supreme" over state law.
See Arthur D. Little, Inc. v. Comm'r of Health and Hosps.
, 395 Mass. 535 , 481 N.E.2d 441, 452 (1985) ("[T]his court has been unable to locate authority in this or any other jurisdiction which supports the proposition that a contract to which the Federal government is a party somehow constitutes Federal law for the purposes of the supremacy clause.").
Taken literally, therefore, FEHBA's preemption provision may fail to withstand constitutional scrutiny unless FEHBA-authorized contracts themselves are "Laws of the United States."
They are not.
"Law" connotes a policy imposed by the government, not a privately-negotiated contract.
See Wolens , 513 U.S. at 229 n. 5, 115 S.Ct. 817 (1995) (finding that "the word series 'law, rule, regulation, standard, or other provision'" as used in a federal statute "connotes official, government-imposed policies, not the terms of a private contract."
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); see also id. at 241 , 115 S.Ct. 817 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part) ("To be sure, the terms of private contracts are not 'laws' ").
Under FEHBA, the government does not impose contract terms as it would impose a law.
Rather, the OPM negotiates the contract terms privately with insurance providers, see generally Doe v. Devine , 703 F.2d 1319, 1321-23 (D.C.Cir.1983), who are under no obligation to enter into the contracts in the first place.
Cf. Evanns v. AT & T Corp. , 229 F.3d 837, 840 n. 9 (9th Cir.2000) ("'[A] tariff, required by law to be filed, is not a mere contract.
It is the law.'"
(quoting Carter v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co. , 365 F.2d 486, 496 (5th Cir.1966))); Marcus v. AT & T Corp. , 138 F.3d 46, 56 (2d Cir.1998) (distinguishing between laws and "mere contracts" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).
Empire's attempt to portray FEHBA contracts as "law" is unavailing.
6 The fact that a literal reading of 8902(m)(1) raises serious constitutional problems does not, however, require us to invalidate the provision.
"[W]here an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems," we may "construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress."
Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Bldg. & Const.
Trades Council , 485 U.S. 568, 575 , 108 S.Ct. 1392 , 99 L.Ed.2d 645 (1988).
This canon of statutory construction, known as "constitutional avoidance," is grounded in "respect for Congress, which we assume legislates in the light of constitutional limitations."
United States v. Pettus , 303 F.3d 480, 486 (2d Cir.2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Here, we can reasonably construe 8902(m)(1) as requiring that, in cases involving the "terms of any contract under [FEHBA] which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits," federal law "shall supersede and preempt any State or local law, or any regulation issued thereunder, which relates to health insurance or plans."
5 U.S.C. 8902(m)(1) .
This construction is as faithful as constitutionally possible to the provision's plain language and respects Congress's stated intent to maintain "uniformity" in FEHBA benefits and to "displace State or local law relating to health insurance or plans."
H.R.Rep.
No. 105-374, at 9, 16 (1997); see also S.Rep.
No. 105-257, at 15 (1997).
The federal law preempting state law may be federal common law or the FEHBA statute provisions themselves, but it must be law—not contract terms.
D. Turning to the effect of 8902(m)(1) on the instant case, we disagree with the argument put forth by Empire and the dissent that the provision somehow authorizes by itself the exercise of federal jurisdiction.
In our view, 8902(m)(1) , which makes no reference to a federal right of action or to federal jurisdiction, is simply a limited preemption clause that the instant dispute does not trigger.
7 Reading 8902(m)(1) as conferring federal jurisdiction over contract disputes between private parties strains the language of the provision and undermines the presumption against federal preemption that should guide our analysis in this case. See Gerosa v. Savasta & Co., Inc. , 329 F.3d 317, 323 (2d Cir.2003) (noting that there is an "assumption that Congress does not intend to supplant state law" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).
Two independent conditions must be satisfied in order to trigger preemption under 8902(m)(1) .
First, preemption only occurs when the FEHBA contract terms at issue "relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits."
5 U.S.C. 8902(m)(1) .
Second, federal law may only preempt state or local laws if those laws "relate[] to health insurance or plans."
8 Id. Empire completely ignores the existence of this second condition, arguing erroneously that because the contract provisions at issue relate to benefits, they necessarily supersede "all state law."
Without any showing that the dispute implicates a specific state law or state common-law principle "relat[ing] to health insurance," 8902(m)(1) does not authorize federal preemption of state law in this case. 9 Judge Raggi argues in dissent that the case satisfies the second condition for 8902(m)(1) preemption on the ground that the phrase "state or local law which relates to health insurance or plans" encompasses laws of general application that make absolutely no reference to health insurance or plans but are used in a given case to "construe or enforce" FEHBA plans.
Post at 158.
In our view, this reading of 8902(m)(1) renders the second limiting condition meaningless.
This is because every state or local law applied to a dispute satisfying the first condition (that is, every state law applied to a dispute involving a contract term relating to coverage or benefits) will ipso facto affect the construction or enforcement of that term.
Thus, under the dissent's reasoning, FEHBA contract terms will preempt every state or local law so long as the first requirement is satisfied.
This strips the second limiting condition of any force whatsoever.
10 Judge Raggi contests this characterization of her analysis, explaining that under her interpretation, the second limiting condition might still impose meaningful limits on preemption "where general state or local law affects FEHBA coverage or benefits only tangentially, without attempting to construe or enforce those plan terms."
Post at 158.
Even in such circumstances, however, the second limiting condition would likely have no meaning that is independent and distinct from the first limiting condition, which requires that the contract terms at issue specifically relate to health coverage in order for preemption to occur.
5 U.S.C. 8902(m)(1) .
In other words, under the circumstances described by Judge Raggi, in which FEHBA coverage is only affected "tangentially," it is highly unlikely that either condition for 8902(m)(1) preemption will be met.
Thus, Judge Raggi's argument does not explain how the second limiting condition carries any independent meaning.
Perhaps, under Judge Raggi's interpretation, the second condition might have independent meaning in a dispute that (1) centers on contract terms specifically relating to health coverage but (2) does not involve the enforcement or construction of those contract terms.
We find it difficult, however, to imagine such a case. 11 In defense of her position, Judge Raggi observes that many Supreme Court and Second Circuit cases construe the term "relates to" quite broadly.
See post at 156-57.
The cases she cites, however, are not directly applicable because they did not involve FEHBA.
As this Court, our sister circuits and the Supreme Court have all recognized, the precise meaning of the vague term "relates to" depends on the larger statutory context.
See, e.g. , Gerosa , 329 F.3d at 323 (stating that "ERISA's nearly limitless 'relates to' language offers no meaningful guidelines to reviewing judges," and that we must therefore "'go beyond the unhelpful text and look instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive'" (quoting New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co. , 514 U.S. 645, 655-56 , 115 S.Ct. 1671 , 131 L.Ed.2d 695 (1995))); Roach v. Mail Handlers Benefit Plan , 298 F.3d 847, 850 (9th Cir.2002) ("'[R]elates to' must be read in the context of the presumption that in fields of traditional state regulation the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by [a] Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.
Here, this means that we must presume that Congress did not intend [FEHBA] to preempt the quintessentially state-law standards of reasonable medical care, because 8902(m)(1) does not indicate a clear and manifest intent to preempt this area of state law."
(second and third alterations in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).
The Supreme Court has specifically warned against overly-broad interpretations of the term, noting that "[i]f 'relate[s] to' were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy, then for all practical purposes pre-emption would never run its course, for really, universally, relations stop nowhere."
Travelers Ins. Co. , 514 U.S. at 655 , 115 S.Ct. 1671 (alteration, citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
To define "relate[s] to" so broadly "would be to read Congress's words of limitation as mere sham, and to read the presumption against pre-emption out of the law whenever Congress speaks to the matter with generality."
Id. 12 We should be especially reluctant to rely on ERISA-based precedent to justify an expansive interpretation of FEHBA's preemption provision, given the fundamental differences between ERISA and FEHBA.
ERISA is significantly more comprehensive than FEHBA, in that it contains multiple preemption provisions and a detailed civil enforcement scheme intended to completely supplant state law.
See Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux , 481 U.S. 41, 54 , 107 S.Ct. 1549 , 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987).
The Supreme Court has relied heavily on ERISA's civil enforcement provisions, as well as those provisions' unambiguous legislative history, to support holdings that broadly construe ERISA's preemptive reach.
See Davila , 124 S.Ct. at 2500 (stating that the Court's understanding of ERISA's preemptive effect is informed by the "overpowering federal policy" embodied in ERISA's civil enforcement provision, which was intended to create "an exclusive federal remedy"); Pilot Life , 481 U.S. at 55 , 107 S.Ct. 1549 (quoting the ERISA Conference Report's statement that all suits to enforce benefits rights "are to be regarded as arising under the laws of the United States" (emphasis omitted)); see also Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon , 498 U.S. 133, 138 , 111 S.Ct. 478 , 112 L.Ed.2d 474 (1990) (noting that ERISA's "deliberately expansive language was designed to establish pension plan regulation as exclusively a federal concern" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); Pilot Life , 481 U.S. at 46 , 107 S.Ct. 1549 (noting ERISA sponsors' emphasis on the "breadth and importance of [ERISA's] preemption provisions").
Given ERISA's comprehensive civil enforcement mechanisms and a legislative history "fully confirm[ing]" that ERISA's remedies were meant to be exclusive, Pilot Life , 481 U.S. at 54 , 107 S.Ct. 1549 , we reject Empire's and Judge Raggi's suggestion that we should rely on ERISA-related precedent to determine the preemptive reach of FEHBA.
See Ingersoll-Rand Co. , 498 U.S. 133 , 111 S.Ct. 478 , 112 L.Ed.2d 474 ; Devlin v. Transp.
Communications Int'l Union , 173 F.3d 94, 98 (2d Cir.1999).
13 The non-ERISA cases on which Judge Raggi relies in her dissent similarly fail to justify the excessively broad interpretation of "relate to" that she favors.
In Coregis Insurance Co. v. American Health Foundation, Inc. , 241 F.3d 123 (2d Cir.2001), for example, the issue was whether certain lawsuits were "related to" a company's financial failure within the meaning of an insurance policy.
We noted that the "[l]awsuits are related to the Companies' financial failure by the very wording of the complaints, which explicitly refer to, discuss, and seek redress for that failure."
Id. at 131 .
In the instant case, neither Empire nor Judge Raggi has cited any state law that "explicitly refer[s] to" or "discuss[es]" health insurance or plans.
Coregis 's rationale therefore does not apply.
14 To the extent we should rely on case law interpreting preemption provisions appearing in other statutes, we find American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens , 513 U.S. 219 , 115 S.Ct. 817 , 130 L.Ed.2d 715 (1995), more relevant and more instructive.
Wolens involved the Airline Deregulation Act (ADA), which bars states from "'enact[ing] or enforc[ing] any law relating to [air carrier] rates, routes, or services.'"
Id. at 221-22 , 115 S.Ct. 817 (quoting 49 U.S.C.App.
1305(a)(1) , now codified as amended at 49 U.S.C. 41713(b) ).
The plaintiffs in Wolens were airline customers who brought state law claims for consumer fraud and breach of contract after the airline retroactively took away their frequent flyer miles.
The Supreme Court held that the consumer fraud claims, which were brought under a state statute, were preempted, but that the breach of contract action was not.
The airline had argued that in passing the ADA, Congress provided that questions of the airline's rights and obligations would be matters of federal and not state law.
The Court disagreed, stating: [It is not] plausible that Congress meant to channel into federal courts the business of resolving, pursuant to judicially fashioned federal common law, the range of contract claims relating to airline rates, routes, or services.
The ADA contains no hint of such a role for the federal courts.
In this regard, the ADA contrasts markedly with the ERISA, which does channel civil actions into the federal courts, under a comprehensive scheme detailed in the legislation, designed to promote prompt and fair claims settlement.
Id. at 232 , 115 S.Ct. 817 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
15 Adopting this same reasoning, we do not believe that FEHBA reveals a congressional objective to resolve all manner of breach of contract suits relating to the Service Benefit Plan in federal court.
16 CONCLUSION If Congress intended for this case to be heard in federal court, it could have created a private right of action for suits against FEHBA beneficiaries; it could have vested jurisdiction over these claims in the federal courts; or it could have included an affirmative grant of authority to the federal courts to create a body of federal common law.
Congress did none of these things.
The preemption provision does not manifest an intent to supplant all state law with federal common law in cases involving FEHBA-authorized contract provisions.
Section 8902(m)(1) plainly establishes that only state laws "relat[ing] to health insurance or plans" are subject to preemption.
We decline Empire's suggestion that we read this phrase out of the provision.
Moreover, even if federal law is likely to preempt McVeigh's defenses and thereby to affect the outcome of the case, this is insufficient to create federal jurisdiction.
The well-pleaded complaint rule requires that the complaint itself arise under federal law in order for there to be federal jurisdiction.
See Briarpatch Ltd. , 373 F.3d at 304 .
Empire's claims are breach-of-contract claims arising under state law.
There is no indication that state law conflicts meaningfully with or is inadequate to achieve the federal interest in this case.
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court's ruling that Empire's claims arise under state law.
