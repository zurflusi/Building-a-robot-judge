 BAUER , Circuit Judge.
Plaintiff Geraldine Cannon brought this civil rights suit against defendants, the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and various individual officers of the schools, after she was rejected as an applicant for admission to the medical schools.
She alleges that she was denied admission because of her age and sex.
The trial court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
We affirm.
Plaintiff at the time of application was 39 years old with a bachelor's degree from Trinity College of Deerfield, Illinois.
Her medical college admission test scores placed her in the lower half of the applicant group.
Her undergraduate grade point average in basic science was 3.17 on a 4.00 scale.
Although the plaintiff's academic credentials were good, statistics for the 1975 entering class at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine indicate the plaintiff faced overwhelming competition; 5,427 persons applied for the 104 positions available at the medical school.
In sharp contrast to plaintiff's grades, the overall average of the entering class was 3.70.
The Dean of the medical school stated in an affidavit that there were at least 2,000 unsuccessful applicants who had better academic qualifications than the plaintiff.
A review of the persons who applied with plaintiff indicates that 1,172 were women and 4,154 were men.
Of the 104 admitted, 19 were female and 85 were male.
Over the past four years, 18.1% of the applicants to the University of Chicago Medical School has been female; over the same period, 18.3% of the entering class has been female.
1 Despite the difficult factual setting 2 in which plaintiff found herself she brought suit alleging age and sex discrimination.
The complaint alleged that her rights were violated under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. 1983 , Title IX of the Education Amendments to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits sex discrimination, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. 621 , and the Public Health Services Act, 799A , 42 U.S.C. 295h-9 .
Plaintiff also filed administrative complaints with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare ("HEW").
Later the complaint was amended naming HEW and its regional director as defendants in the suit.
3 In affirming the dismissal of the complaint we will consider each of plaintiff's jurisdictional claims individually.
I. INSUFFICIENT STATE ACTION EXISTS FOR FEDERAL JURISDICTION UNDER 42 U.S.C. 1983 .
Plaintiff's chief allegation is that the defendants' rejection of her application for admission to medical school deprived her of equal protection of the laws in violation of 42 U.S.C. 1983 .
4 The district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction over this claim on the ground that plaintiff had failed to meet the "state action" requirement of 1983 .
In so ruling, Judge Hoffman specifically applied the standards for the "state action" requirement which have been articulated in recent years by the United States Supreme Court and by this Court.
In Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis , 5 407 U.S. 163, 173 , 92 S.Ct. 1965 , 32 L.Ed.2d 627 (1972), a black guest was refused service in a private club's dining room because of his race.
Since the club was operating pursuant to a liquor license issued by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board and was subject to detailed regulations by the Pennsylvania Board, the plaintiff argued that sufficient "state action" was present to establish a violation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights.
The Court rejected the "state action" claim, observing: supra Reitman v. Mulkey 387 U.S. 369, 380 87 S.Ct. 1627, 1634 18 L.Ed.2d 830 407 U.S. at 173 92 S.Ct. at 1971 The requirement of state action was explained even more fully by the Supreme Court in Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Comm. , 419 U.S. 345 , 95 S.Ct. 449 , 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974).
Suit was brought under 1983 against a private utility company seeking an injunction and damages for the termination of plaintiff's electrical services without notice, a hearing, or an opportunity to pay any amounts due.
The claim of state action was based upon the following allegations: (1) the State had conferred monopoly status upon the utility company; (2) the utility performed a public service required to be supplied on a continuous basis under the law, hence performing a "public function"; and (3) the State "specifically authorized and approved" the termination practice.
In holding that this was insufficient for a finding of state action under 1983 , the Supreme Court outlined the relevant test: Public Utilities Comm'n v. Pollak 343 U.S. 451, 462 72 S.Ct. 813, 820 96 L.Ed. 1068 Moose Lodge No. 107 supra, at 176 92 S.Ct. at 1973 419 U.S. at 350-51 95 S.Ct. at 453 The Supreme Court has thus made clear that neither general government involvement nor even extensive detailed state regulation is sufficient for a finding of state action.
Rather, the state must affirmatively support and be directly involved in the specific conduct which is being challenged.
6 Plaintiff in this case makes an allegation that because the medical school receives money from the State its admission decisions are made differently than school administrators would otherwise decide on the basis of academic policy.
We see nothing in the record to support this conclusory allegation.
7 Plaintiff argues that the giving of financial assistance by the State is tantamount to direct involvement of the State.
See Weise v. Syracuse University , 522 F.2d 397 (2d Cir. 1975); Grafton v. Brooklyn Law School , 478 F.2d 1137, 1142 (2d Cir. 1973); Braden v. University of Pittsburgh , 477 F.2d 1, 6 (3d Cir. 1973); Brown v. Strickler , 422 F.2d 1000, 1001 (6th Cir. 1970); Rackin v. University of Pennsylvania , 386 F.Supp.
992, 1001 (E.D.Pa.
1974); Isaacs v. Board of Trustees of Temple University , 385 F.Supp.
473, 479 (E.D.Pa.
1974).
We agree that in some situations state financial assistance can amount to state action.
But in this case we do not believe that the character and amount of assistance mandates a finding of state action.
As Justice Stevens (then Circuit Judge) stated in Cohen v. I. I. T. , 524 F.2d 818, 825 (7th Cir. 1975): A reading of the cases indicates that the concept of state action depends not only upon the amount of state financial assistance but also upon the type of injury alleged.
In this case, where there appears to be no state connection to the injury alleged, where there is no indication that the State exercises any control of the medical schools' admissions policies, it would be improper to divest the medical schools of their private character.
This Court has followed the approach outlined by the Supreme Court in requiring a "nexus" between the State and the challenged conduct in several recent decisions.
For example, in Doe v. Bellin Memorial Hospital , 479 F.2d 756 (7th Cir. 1973), a doctor and a pregnant woman seeking to use a hospital's facilities for the purpose of performing an abortion filed a lawsuit against the hospital and its officials.
Jurisdiction was claimed under 1983 based on the fact that the defendant hospital had "accepted financial support .
.
.
from both the federal [Hill-Burton Act] and state governments, .
.
.
[was] subject to detailed regulation by the State" and "had been an agency through which the State of Wisconsin and the United States Government [had] provided medical services for residents of Northeastern Wisconsin .
.
.
."
479 F.2d at 758, 761 .
The Court rejected the claim of 1983 jurisdiction, finding that the "record [did] not reflect any governmental involvement in the very activity .
.
.
being challenged."
Id. at 761 .
The Court made clear that the governmental involvement necessary to meet the "state action" requirement under 1983 must be "affirmative support" measured by its direct contribution to the conduct at issue.
Such affirmative support was lacking in Doe , the Court held, as "there [was] no claim that the state [had] sought to influence hospital policy respecting abortions, either by direct regulation or by discriminatory application of its powers or its benefits."
In sum, the Court concluded: 1983 Id. at 761 See also Driscoll v. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 139 , 484 F.2d 682, 690 (7th Cir. 1973), cert. denied 415 U.S. 960 , 94 S.Ct. 1490 , 39 L.Ed.2d 375 (1974) ("To be regulable under constitutional standards through 1331 or 1983 , the very activity of a private entity which a plaintiff challenges must be supported by state action that significantly fosters or encourages that activity.
"); Lucas v. Wisconsin Electric Company , 466 F.2d 638, 654-56 (7th Cir. 1972) (en banc), cert. denied 409 U.S. 1114 , 93 S.Ct. 928 , 34 L.Ed.2d 696 (1973); Bright v. Isenbarger , 445 F.2d 412 (7th Cir. 1971) (per curiam).
Finally, this Court's recent decision in Cohen v. Illinois Institute of Technology , supra , is fully dispositive of plaintiff's 1983 claim here.
There, a female assistant professor brought suit under 1983 against I.I.T.
and some of its officers alleging that the university had discriminated against her in appointment, retention, and compensation on account of her sex.
The district court dismissed the 1983 claim because I.I.T.
is not a state school and plaintiff had not shown state involvement in the personnel practices which she challenged.
384 F.Supp.
202 (N.D.Ill.
1974).
This Court affirmed the dismissal, stating: 524 F.2d at 825-826 See also, Greco v. Orange Memorial Hospital Corp. , 513 F.2d 873, 880 (5th Cir. 1975); Ascherman v. Presbyterian Hospital of Pacific Medical Center, Inc. , 507 F.2d 1103, 1105 (9th Cir. 1974); Ward v. St. Anthony Hospital , 476 F.2d 671, 674-75 (10th Cir. 1973); Blackburn v. Fisk University , 443 F.2d 121, 124 (6th Cir. 1971).
In this case all that plaintiff alleges is the receipt of state and federal financial assistance.
8 But, even assuming financial aid and assistance by the State in whatever amounts, such aid and assistance is insufficient for jurisdiction under 1983 unless it can be shown that the State has "affirmatively supported" the particular conduct challenged here.
Plaintiff asserts that her mere allegation of "particularly offensive discrimination in violation of national policy" obviates the requirement that there be a nexus between the State and the challenged activity.
We cannot subscribe to such a position, for Moose Lodge itself, which articulated the nexus requirement, involved race discrimination which is obviously both offensive and in violation of national policy.
Moreover, Cohen also involved the issue of sex discrimination, yet this Court was clear in its requirement that detailed state regulation is not enough unless the "regulatory agency has encouraged the practice in question, or at least given its affirmative approval to the practice."
524 F.2d at 826 .
II.
TITLE IX DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THIS SITUATION.
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. 1681 , et seq.
, prohibits discrimination based on sex in most educational institutions receiving federal financial assistance.
Title IX states: Plaintiff maintains that Title IX provides an independent basis of federal jurisdiction for her action.
On the other hand, the defendants claim that Title IX does not provide an independent cause of action in federal court, but rather, provides for mandatory administrative procedures followed only then by judicial review.
The question, we believe, is one of first impression.
9 Consequently we must look to the intent of Congress, as well as the experience of the courts in dealing with similar statutes.
Plaintiffs rely heavily upon previous decisions based upon Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d , et seq.
, the language 10 of which is identical to Title IX except that it bars racial discrimination.
But our reading of the cases does not indicate that Title VI provides a private right of action for each individual discriminatee.
Those cases involved an attempt by a large number of plaintiffs to enforce a national constitutional right.
See Lau v. Nichols , 414 U.S. 563 , 94 S.Ct. 786 , 39 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974); Bossier Parish School Board v. Lemon , 370 F.2d 847 (5th Cir. 1967).
Justice Blackmun in his opinion in Lau warned against an overly broad reading of the case, stating: 414 U.S. at 571-72 94 S.Ct. at 791 The limitations of Lau were adopted by the Tenth Circuit in Serna v. Portales Municipal Schools , 499 F.2d 1147, 1154 (10th Cir. 1974), when the Court noted: Lau It appears that Lau and Bossier were desegregation cases involving attempts to deprive large groups of minorities of their right to equal educational opportunities.
But they simply do not give any real support to plaintiff's argument that we must infer an individual right of action under Title IX in favor of a person who has a grievance based upon sexual discrimination against a private educational institution receiving government funds.
Admittedly the courts have implied private causes of action under statutes which were silent as to the existence of a judicial remedy. 11 However, in this instance, construing Title IX to provide a private cause of action before the administrative remedy has been exhausted would be to violate the intent of Congress.
In enacting Title IX Congress established a scheme through which its prohibition against sex discrimination would be enforced by HEW, the administrative agency empowered to extend the federal aid.
The statute encourages voluntary compliance in the first instance, an opportunity for an administrative hearing on the issue of discrimination if necessary, and the withdrawal of federal funds as a last resort for a recalcitrant institution which has been found to discriminate in violation of the Act.
12 After department or agency action, there is a right to judicial review.
13 It is clear that no individual right of action can be inferred from Title IX in the face of the carefully constructed scheme of administrative enforcement contained in the Act.
As the United States Supreme Court stated in National Railroad Passenger Corp. [Amtrak] v. National Ass'n.
of Railroad Passengers , 414 U.S. 453, 458 , 94 S.Ct. 690, 693 , 38 L.Ed.2d 646 (1974), while refusing to infer a private cause of action from the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970: Botany Worsted Mills v. United States 278 U.S. 282, 289 49 S.Ct. 129, 132 73 L.Ed. 379 In Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Barbour , 421 U.S. 412 , 95 S.Ct. 1733 , 44 L.Ed.2d 263 (1975), the Supreme Court held that the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, which established a nonprofit corporation, SIPC, to provide financial relief to customers of failing broker-dealers, did not create a private right of action for such customers to compel SIPC to exercise its statutory authority for their benefit.
Following Amtrak , the Court stated as follows: National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Association of Railroad Passengers 414 U.S. 453 [457-58 94 S.Ct. 690 38 L.Ed.2d 646 In Cort v. Ash , 422 U.S. 66 , 95 S.Ct. 2080 , 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975), the Supreme Court held that a private right of action could not be implied by a shareholder under 18 U.S.C. 610 , which prohibits corporations from making contributions or expenditures in connection with certain federal elections.
The Court based its decision in part on the absence of any evidence that Congress had intended a private right of action for violations of the statute.
422 U.S. at 82-83 , 95 S.Ct. 2080 .
The teaching of Amtrak , SIPC and Cort , supra , is that a private cause of action should not be lightly implied under a statute where Congress has not specifically provided one--especially where Congress has provided for other means of enforcement.
14 The Congressional history of Title IV leaves no doubt that our legislators were quite concerned about women being placed in an unequal position in seeking admission to institutions of higher learning.
1972 U.S.Code Cong. and Admin. News 2462, 2512.
But the Congressional reports also indicate that many of the legislators believed that attempts at ending sexual discrimination were better achieved on a voluntary basis rather than by additional governmental regulation.
Apparently none of the Congressmen envisioned the rather drastic remedy of individual lawsuits.
15 None of the reports mention the fact that a private cause of action might be implied under Title IX.
From a policy viewpoint we see little to be gained by involving the judiciary in every individual act of discrimination based upon sex.
Perhaps our resources would be better spent in litigation challenging wholesale sexual discrimination against a large number of men or women by a particular educational institution.
16 Title VI has been effectively employed in this fashion, and we see no reason why Title IX would not provide a similar jurisdictional base for those cases where the administrative abilities of HEW would be inundated or inadequate.
However, for the day-to-day problems, stemming from the long overdue social revolution in equality of the sexes, we think the HEW administrative procedure is best.
17 Although some commentators 18 have taken the view that working through HEW is painstakingly show and ineffective, 19 we fail to see how a private lawsuit by individual parties would facilitate an end to sex discrimination.
To allow a private right of action would be engaging in judicial legislation.
Considering our already overburdened system we fail to see why we should stretch a statute by judicial interpretation to the point where it would allow additional litigation which we may not be able to properly accommodate.
III.
THE AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THIS CASE. Plaintiff also seeks to claim jurisdiction for this suit under the Age Discrimination Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. 621 et seq.
20 Her amended complaint contends that the denial of admission to medical school has the effect of barring her from securing employment as a doctor of medicine.
In addition to sexual discrimination, she claims that she was denied admission because of her age.
21 Plaintiff argues that each defendant medical school functions as an employment agency in regularly undertaking to procure doctors as employees for their university hospitals.
The term employment agency, as defined in 29 U.S.C. 630(c) , 22 means any person regularly undertaking with or without compensation to procure employees for employers and includes an agent of such person.
Litigation concerning the meaning of the term employment agency is rather sparse and primarily has been confined to cases arising under a very similar definition of the term under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 2000e(c) , 23 but generally it has been held to include "only those engaged to a significant degree in that kind of activity as their profession or business."
Brush v. San Francisco Newspaper Printing Co. , 315 F.Supp.
577, 580 (N.D.Cal.
1970), aff'd, 469 F.2d 89 (9th Cir. 1972), cert. denied 410 U.S. 943 , 93 S.Ct. 1369 , 35 L.Ed.2d 609 .
See also Greenfield v. Field Enterprises , 4 Fair Employment Practice Cases 548 (N.D.Ill.
1972).
In Greenfield , a Title VII case, the court stated that "the act clearly defines the activities of an employment agency in the traditional and generally accepted sense of that term.
.
.
.
Nothing in the statute or legislative history suggest a broader or different meaning."
Id. at 550 .
However, in a recent decision, Kaplowitz v. University of Chicago , 387 F.Supp.
42 (N.D.Ill.
1974), the district court acknowledged that a liberal construction of the term employment agency was required to best effectuate the purposes of Title VII, and found that the University of Chicago Law School was significantly involved in operating allegedly discriminatory placement facilities, stressing the importance to the school of finding employment for its graduates.
24 Taking plaintiff's allegations as true and further assuming for purposes of argument a liberal construction of the term employment agency holding that the defendants do operate employment agencies, we nevertheless agree with the district court that the complaint fails to allege age discrimination in connection with employment.
Plaintiff is seeking admission to the defendant schools as a medical student, not as an individual seeking employment through the schools.
Plaintiff admits that the defendants have not failed or refused to refer her for employment on the basis of her age.
The purpose of the Act is to provide employment opportunities and hiring for persons between the ages of 40 and 65 without discrimination based on age.
This purpose was based upon the finding that older workers found themselves disadvantaged in their efforts to retain or regain employment after being dismissed from their jobs.
Nothing in the statute nor the legislative history suggests a broader interpretation.
In order for an individual to state a claim under the Act, that individual must be qualified to accept employment and only then have been discriminated against on the basis of age.
Plaintiff's claim is too remote--she has not successfully completed the necessary prerequisites to be in a position to fall within the protection of the Act.
Her complaint merely amounts to an allegation of discrimination in admission to a university and fails to state anything beyond a remote connection to discrimination in employment.
As such, the complaint fails to state a claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.
We also note that procedurally plaintiff has failed to comply with the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.
The Act authorizes a civil action only after giving notice to the Secretary of Labor sixty days before the suit is filed under 29 U.S.C. 626(d) .
25 The purpose of this requirement is to allow the Secretary an opportunity "to eliminate any alleged unlawful practice by informal methods of conciliation, conference, and persuasion."
There is no indication in the record that plaintiff has complied with this jurisdictional prerequisite.
Therefore, even if we accepted plaintiff's argument that a valid cause of action existed under the Act, we would still have to dismiss for want to jurisdiction.
IV.
JURISDICTION DOES NOT EXIST UNDER THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES ACT OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT.
Section 799A of the Public Health Services Act 26 provides that the Secretary of HEW may not give financial assistance to schools which discriminate on the basis of sex.
Plaintiff claims that this statute gives her the right to maintain a private right of action against the medical schools as a third party beneficiary under the Act.
Although Section 799A does not provide for a private cause of action, there have been some situations in which the courts have allowed a suit to go forward under an implied right theory.
27 In this case we believe that to imply jurisdiction under the Act for a private lawsuit would be improvident.
This is a suit by a single plaintiff against two predominantly private institutions.
In fact, should a court grant her requested relief, it would require discriminating against the 2,000 other applicants who had better qualifications than plaintiff.
Finally, plaintiff claims that jurisdiction exists under 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act, which authorizes a court to "compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed."
We cannot sustain this suit on this jurisdictional basis since HEW is actively investigating plaintiff's complaint and the delay involved of about one year has not been unreasonable.
Accordingly, the decision of the district court in dismissing the complaint is hereby affirmed.
AFFIRMED.
