 FLETCHER , Circuit Judge: In 1996 California voters passed Proposition 198, which converted the State's primary election from a closed to a blanket primary in which voters may vote for any candidate regardless of the voter's or candidate's party affiliation.
Appellants, the California Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, and Peace and Freedom Parties, together with other individuals, opponents of Proposition 198, seek reversal of the district court's judgment upholding its constitutionality.
California Democratic Party v. Jones , 984 F.Supp.
1288 (E.D.Cal.1997).
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1291 , and we affirm.
STANDARD OF REVIEW We review the constitutionality of a statute de novo.
Crawford v. Lungren , 96 F.3d 380, 384 (9th Cir.1996), cert. denied , 520 U.S. 1117 , 117 S.Ct. 1249 , 137 L.Ed.2d 330 (1997).
A district court's determinations on questions of law and on mixed questions of law and fact that implicate constitutional rights are also reviewed de novo.

We have undertaken that review.

Because we concur in it in every respect, we have elected to adopt it as the opinion of our court.
We attach it as an appendix.
It also may be found at 984 F.Supp.
1288 (E.D.Cal.1997) sub nom.
