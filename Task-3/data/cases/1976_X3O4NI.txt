 McGOWAN , Circuit Judge: Congress has been continuously concerned from its inception with the problem of maintaining an adequately manned military establishment for the protection of our national interests.
Although one controversial response to that problem has been the operation of a system of compulsory military service, Congress has also--especially in recent years--attempted to provide a sufficient monetary incentive to attract men and women to careers in the military.
One approach that has frequently been chosen by Congress is the award of a monetary bonus--recently labeled a "Regular Reenlistment Bonus"--to enlisted personnel who reenlist or extend the period of their obligated service.
1 Since 1965, Congress has also provided an additional reenlistment bonus--a "Variable Reenlistment Bonus"--to enlisted personnel whose skills are in critically short supply.
2 That Variable Reenlistment Bonus (VRB), which is available to enlisted personnel eligible for a Regular [**35] Reenlistment Bonus (RRB), is set by regulation at a multiple of the RRB.
3 The seven named plaintiffs who filed this class suit in the District Court are enlisted personnel in the United States Navy who claim that they are entitled by contract or under the doctrine of promissory estoppel to receive VRBs equal to four times the amount of their respective RRBs.
We conclude that the District Court properly asserted jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) , 4 and, for the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the District Court ordering payment of VRBs to the named plaintiffs.
5 We affirm the District Court's order certifying the suit as a class action under Rule 23(b)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and awarding attorneys' fees of $14,729.
And finally, we remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings concerning an award of attorneys' fees for the efforts of counsel directed to this appeal.
I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND On June 23, 1969 plaintiff Larionoff enlisted in the United States Navy for four years.
Shortly thereafter, he underwent a series of tests and interviews to determine his appropriate duty assignment.
During the course of those interviews with Navy personnel, Larionoff decided to participate in the Advanced Electronic Field (AEF) training program, successful completion of which would place him in the Communications Technician-Maintenance (CTM) service rating.
At the time he decided to enter the AEF program, Larionoff was aware that the CTM rating was classified as a "critical military skill" qualifying for a Variable Reenlistment Bonus equal to four times the amount of an enlisted member's Regular Reenlistment Bonus.
6 Under applicable Navy regulations, the AEF program involved a six year service obligation, and plaintiff Larionoff consequently executed the following "Agreement to Extend Enlistment": years, in consideration of the pay, allowances, and benefits which will accrue to me during the continuances of my service Section 5539 App. at 134 (emphasis added).
On that same day, plaintiff Larionoff executed a document requesting assignment to the AEF program and acknowledging his six year obligation: [**36] sic App. at 135.
On March 9, 1970 Larionoff successfully completed the AEF training program and was advanced to the CTM rating and the E-4 pay grade.
He executed a document on that date attesting to his advancement to the E-4 pay grade.
7 Up to this point in time, neither the Navy nor plaintiff Larionoff had reason to complain about the events that had transpired.
The complicating factor, however, was that Larionoff still expected to receive a Variable Reenlistment Bonus once he entered into his period of extended service on June 23, 1973.
The Navy cast some doubt on that expectation when it announced on March 24, 1972 that effective July 1, 1972 the CTM rating would no longer be designated as a "critical military skill" eligible for the VRB award.
After realizing that the Navy considered him ineligible for a Variable Reenlistment Bonus, Larionoff had his elected representatives in Congress communicate with the Bureau of Naval Personnel concerning his eligibility for the VRB.
8 These efforts were unsuccessful; the Bureau asserted that the CTM service rating had been removed from the list of eligible service ratings, thus precluding payment of a VRB to plaintiff Larionoff.
9 The other six named plaintiffs 10 have undergone similar administrative processing by the Navy.
They all signed extension agreements 11 subsequent to April 20, 1966 (the date the CTM rating was designated as a "critical military skill") extending their enlistments for two years for the purpose of receiving AEF training; executed documents requesting assignment to AEF training and acknowledging their six year obligations; received their training, were advanced to the CTM rating and the E-4 pay grade prior to July 1, 1972; executed documents attesting to their advancement to the E-4 pay grade; entered the extension periods of their enlistments subsequent to July 1, 1972 (the date that the "critical military skill" designation for the CTM rating was terminated); and received their Regular Reenlistment Bonuses.
12 [**37] On March 30, 1973, the named plaintiffs filed this class action 13 in the District Court seeking either payment of the VRB award level in effect when the extension agreements were signed or rescission of their extension agreements.
14 On September 28, 1973, the District Court certified the action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(1)(B); granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and ordered payment of VRBs; and awarded plaintiffs' counsel attorneys' fees of $14,729.00 to be obtained from the class recovery.
The Government appeals, claiming error with respect to both the grant of the motion for summary judgment and the class certification.
The plaintiffs cross-appeal with respect to the failure of the District Court (1) to order rescission, (2) to order disclosure by the government of the names of members of the class, and (3) to compensate adequately plaintiffs' attorneys.
II.
ENTITLEMENT TO THE VARIABLE REENLISTMENT BONUS Plaintiffs offer two theories to support their contention that they are entitled to receive VRBs.
They first argue that they executed their extension agreements "in consideration of the pay, allowances, and benefits" which were to accrue during the period of extended service, see 175 U.S.App.D.C.
pages , 533 F.2d page 1170 supra , and that the term "pay" includes awards of VRB.
As an alternative ground, plaintiffs maintain that they are entitled to receive VRBs on a theory of promissory estoppel in that they relied to their detriment on oral representations concerning VRB eligibility made by naval personnel attempting to get them to execute extension agreements.
We find it unnecessary to reach the issue of promissory estoppel since we find that under applicable military regulations plaintiffs are entitled to VRBs as part of the "consideration" for which they executed extension agreements.
15 Since our interpretation of the relevant regulations depends in part on the legislative history of the statutory provisions delegating to the Secretary of Defense the authority to prescribe eligibility criteria, we turn first to an analysis of the basic statutory provisions establishing the VRB award.
A. Statutory Provisions As early as 1795, Congress provided by statute for the payment of a "reenlistment [**38] bonus" to members of the armed services who reenlisted within a short period following their separation from the service, and eligibility for that bonus was eventually extended to those who agreed to extend the length of their service obligation prior to the expiration of the period for which they had agreed to serve.
16 The method of computing the amount of the bonus has varied, but by 1954 Congress settled on the following formula: the monthly basic pay of the serviceman at the time of discharge or release times the number of years specified in the reenlistment contract.
See Act of July 16, 1954, Pub.L.No.506, 2 , 68 Stat. 488 .
17 The Department of Defense eventually recognized that the statutory formula was inefficient since it failed to vary the monetary incentive for reenlistment according to the needs of the armed services for personnel with particular skills.
In other words, if a branch of the armed services was adequately manned except for a critical shortage of communications technicians, that [**39] branch would nevertheless be prohibited by statute from offering communications technicians a stronger incentive in the form of a larger reenlistment bonus.
Consequently, the President's 1965 legislative proposals to Congress concerning increased pay for servicemen included a recommendation that the Department of Defense be authorized to award an additional flexible reenlistment bonus to enable the Department to provide a strong reenlistment incentive to those personnel whose skills were in short supply.
18 The Defense Department urged both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees to act favorably on this Variable Reenlistment Bonus incentive provision: In a few of the most critically undermanned specialties, comprising about 5 percent of our force strength, losses of $10,000 or more occur whenever a first termer fails to reenlist and operational capability suffers because of severe shortages of careerists A reenlistment bonus concentrates retention money at the reenlistment decision point, thereby getting the most drawing power per retention dollar H.R.Rep.No.549, 89th Cong., 1st Sess.
47-48 (1965) (emphasis added).
See S.Rep.No.544, 89th Cong., 1st Sess.
18 (1965), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1965, p. 2745; Hearings on H.R.
5725 and H.R.
8714 Before the House Comm. on Armed Services, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., ser. 13, at 2545, (1965) (Statement of then Secretary McNamara).
Both committees approved the following Variable Reenlistment Bonus award provision: 19 In the course of the floor debate over what was to become the Uniformed Services Pay Act of 1965, it became quite clear the Department of Defense had convinced the Congress that the VRB provision was cost-justified since it would save the Government the cost of training a replacement [**40] whenever a first term enlisted member decided to reenlist.
20 See, e. g. , 111 Cong.Rec.
17206 (1965) ("[T]he career motivation that will be generated among the hard core elements, specifically the highly technically trained people throughout the services, will more than make up in actual dollars saved for the cost of the legislation.")
(remarks of Representative Morton); id. at 17206 ("It is just plain good personnel planning to provide a $4,000 bonus to encourage reenlistment rather than pay $10,000 to train a replacement.")
(remarks of Representative Bennett); id. at 17209 (remarks of Representative Dole); id. at 20034 (remarks of Senator Russell).
And it is also clear that Congress viewed the VRB provision as an effective incentive to be brought to the attention of enlisted personnel at the point in time when they are choosing whether and how long to continue military service.
21 See, e. g., id. at 17201 ("The [variable reenlistment] bonus would channel additional pay into these specialties.
It offers the incentive toward career service at just the time that it will be most effective, when an individual decides whether or not to reenlist.")
(remarks of Representative Nedzi).
With these objectives in mind, Congress enacted the VRB provision as recommended by the House and Senate committees, delegating to the Secretary of Defense the authority to issue regulations for the administration of the VRB program.
Act of August 21, 1965, Pub.L.No.89-132, 3 , 79 Stat. 547 , as amended , Act of Oct. 22, 1968, Pub.L.No.90-623, 3(1), 5, 82 Stat. 1314-15 , as amended , 37 U.S.C. 308 (Supp. IV, 1974).
B. Military Regulations 22 In interpreting the regulations issued by both the Department of Defense and the Department of the Navy with respect to the VRB program, it is important to emphasize the narrow question at issue.
The Government takes the position that under applicable military regulations eligibility for a Variable Reenlistment Bonus attaches at the date of actual entry into the reenlistment or extension period.
Brief at 21.
The Government does not argue that appellants would not have been entitled to a VRB if the CTM service rating had been designated as a critical military specialty when they entered their periods of extended service.
23 Nor does the Government argue that appellants are not entitled to the Regular Reenlistment Bonus that at least until 1974 was automatically paid upon extension or reenlistment.
24 The Government simply maintains that appellants are entitled only to the VRB in effect when they actually entered into the period of extended service, which for each appellant amounts to zero.
At first glance, the applicable military regulations would seem to support the Government's position.
The Department of Defense Directive prescribing policies for award of the VRB deals specifically with the question of reduction and termination of VRB awards: [**41] DOD Directive 1304.14, ¶ IV.F.
(Sept. 3, 1970).
Of course, that Directive is at best ambiguous, in that it is not clear whether a VRB is "awarded" when an enlisted member signs an agreement to extend enlistment or when he or she actually begins to serve the period of extension.
Section IV.D.2.
of the Directive, however, tells us that "[s]pecific provisions for individual eligibility of enlisted members for receipt of awards" are contained in a separate Department of Defense Instruction.
That separate regulation also addresses the question of reduction and termination of awards: except as provided in paragraph V.B.1.f.
above Department of Defense Instruction 1304.15, ¶ VI.A.
(Sept. 3, 1970) (emphasis added).
Were it not for the "except" clause, this regulation would also apparently support the Government's interpretation of the VRB program.
25 The question thus becomes whether "paragraph V.B.1.f."
leads to a different result.
The relevant portion of paragraph V.B.1.
provides that "[a]n enlisted member is eligible to receive a Variable Reenlistment Bonus if he .
.
.
Eligibility attained through any modification of an existing service obligation, including any early discharge granted pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1171 , must have been attained prior to the date the authority approving the modification was notified of the prospective termination or reduction of award in the military specialty (Emphasis added.)
And the regulations issued by the Department of the Navy indicate that an extension of enlistment qualifies as a form of "modification of an existing service obligation": or extension of enlistment, or other modification of an existing service obligation BUPER INST 1133.18E, ¶ 7.h.
(Mar. 23, 1972) (emphasis added).
Paragraph V.B.1.f.
of the Defense Instruction and paragraph 7.h.
of the Navy Instruction were apparently designed to prevent enlisted members from receiving the higher award level of a VRB scheduled for reduction merely by modifying their service obligations after learning of the planned reduction but prior to its effective date.
Thus, if the Navy announced on March 24, 1972 that a VRB with a multiple of four was to be reduced to a multiple of two for the CTM rating effective July 1, 1972, an enlisted member extending his or her service obligation after March 24, [**42] 1972 26 and entering on the period of extension prior to July 1, 1972 would nevertheless be entitled only to the lower VRB award level with a multiple of two.
Only those enlisted personnel modifying their service obligations prior to March 24, 1972 would have attained eligibility for the higher VRB award level with a multiple of four.
The application of these regulations to appellants leads us to conclude that they are entitled to the VRB award level in effect on the date they signed their respective agreements to extend enlistment.
27 Those agreements were executed prior to March 24, 1972, the date on which the Navy announced termination effective July 1, 1972 of the VRB award for the CTM rating.
If appellants are otherwise entitled to receive a VRB award, as the Government concedes they are, that award is not to be determined according to the award level in effect on the date they actually entered into their respective periods of extension, but rather according to the award level in effect when they executed their extension agreements.
To hold otherwise would undermine the explicit language of paragraphs V.B.1.f.
and 7.h.
of the appropriate regulations, in that neither those who extended their enlistments on or after March 24, 1972 nor those who extended their enlistments before March 24, 1972 could attain eligibility for the higher award if they were to begin their extended service on a date after July 1, 1972.
The paragraphs referred to above obviously contemplate a situation in which enlisted personnel attain eligibility prior to the point at which they enter into periods of extended service.
Moreover, the Government's interpretation would lead to results clearly at odds with the explicit congressional objectives.
For example, under the Government's approach an enlisted member who signed an extension agreement when the VRB award level was at a multiple of two but entered into extended service when the multiple was set at four would receive the higher award level.
Despite the fact that a bonus with a multiple of two was a sufficient reenlistment incentive for that enlisted member, the Government would apparently award him a windfall in the form of a bonus with a multiple of four.
The Government's interpretation would also frustrate congressional objectives by complicating the decision whether to reenlist.
The legislative history indicates that Congress intended to offer enlisted personnel a specific sum 28 in addition to the automatic Regular Reenlistment Bonus as an incentive to reenlist in skill areas in critically short supply.
Under the Government's approach, an enlisted member (with a skill designated as critical) considering extension of service would have to weigh not the current VRB award level, but the VRB award level in effect on the date on which he or she would actually begin serving the period of extension.
The latter VRB award level would be a function of the Navy's manpower needs at that time as well as the extent to which the prospect of an uncertain VRB award level had already helped to satisfy those requirements.
Information concerning those factors would rarely be readily accessible to enlisted personnel making a reenlistment or extension decision, and we find no evidence in the legislative background of the 1965 amendments to [**43] warrant the conclusion that Congress intended enlisted personnel to make reenlistment decisions in the face of such uncertainty.
29 The Government authored these extensions contracts, and it could easily have inserted a provision limiting an enlisted member's VRB eligibility to the award level in effect on the date of actual entry into the period of extended service.
Undoubtedly, if such a provision had been included, the Navy would have witnessed fewer extensions of enlistment.
30 But there is no express limitation on eligibility, and the Government is therefore bound by the actual contract terms and the applicable military regulations.
Although we recognize that these rather complex military regulations are not free from ambiguity, the factors outlined above lead us to conclude that under a reasonable interpretation of the contracts the appellants are entitled to the VRB award level in effect at the time they signed their extension contracts.
Our conclusion in that regard is reinforced by our obligation to construe most strongly against the Government, as against any other drafter of a contract, ambiguous contract terms that are subject to a reasonable and practical interpretation other than that offered by the drafter.
United States v. Seckinger , 397 U.S. 203, 210 , 90 S.Ct. 880 , 25 L.Ed.2d 224 (1970); 3 A. Corbin, Contracts 559 (1960).
Since the regulations at issue recognize that eligibility can be attained prior to actual entry into the period of extended service, and since the Government's interpretation of the regulations, unlike that of the plaintiffs, is at odds with congressional intent, 31 we construe the contracts to mean that appellants are entitled to the VRB award level in effect when they signed their extension agreements.
32 [**44] C. The 1974 Repeal of the Variable Reenlistment Bonus Program Effective June 1, 1974, Congress repealed the statutory provisions providing for the Regular Reenlistment Bonus and the Variable Reenlistment Bonus and substituted a provision authorizing a new "Selective Reenlistment Bonus" (SRB).
Armed Forces Enlisted Personnel Bonus Revision Act of 1974, Pub.L.No.93-277, 2(1) , 37 U.S.C. 308 (Supp. IV, 1974).
33 The 1974 amendments specifically provide that an enlisted member on active duty on the effective date of the amendments "who would have been eligible, at the end of his current or subsequent enlistment, for the [Regular Reenlistment Bonus] as it existed on the day before the effective date of [the amendments] shall continue to be eligible for the [RRB] as it existed on the day before the effective date of [the amendments]."
But a similar savings clause was not enacted for enlisted personnel eligible for a Variable Reenlistment Bonus before the effective date of the 1974 amendments.
Consequently, although it has not been raised by any of the parties, we are confronted with the question whether named plaintiff Johnson, who was scheduled to enter his period of extended service after the effective date of the 1974 amendments, is no longer entitled to receive a VRB.
34 Since contractual rights against the government are property interests protected by the Fifth Amendment, Congressional power to abrogate existing government contracts is narrowly circumscribed.
Perry v. United States , 294 U.S. 330 , 55 S.Ct. 432 , 79 L.Ed. 912 (1935); Lynch v. United States , 292 U.S. 571 , 54 S.Ct. 840 , 78 L.Ed. 1434 (1934); see Federal Housing Administration v. Darlington, Inc. , 358 U.S. 84, 97-98 , 79 S.Ct. 141 , 3 L.Ed.2d 132 (1958) (Harlan, J., dissenting).
And although Congress may constitutionally impair existing contract rights in the exercise of a paramount governmental power such as the "War Powers," U.S.Const.
art.
I, 8 , cl.
11, 12, 14, Congress is "without power to reduce [**45] expenditures by abrogating contractual obligations of the United States."
Lynch v. United States , supra , 292 U.S. at 580 , 54 S.Ct. at 844 (emphasis added); see id. at 579 .
Compare Schultz v. Clifford , 303 F.Supp.
965 (D.Minn.1968), aff'd , 417 F.2d 775 (8th Cir. 1969), cert. denied , 397 U.S. 1007 , 90 S.Ct. 1234 , 25 L.Ed.2d 420 (1970); Pfile v. Corcoran , 287 F.Supp.
554 (D.Colo.1968).
Although the stated purpose of the 1974 amendments was to "provide authority to grant enlistment and reenlistment bonuses to enlisted personnel on a selective basis to fill critical and shortage skill requirements in the armed services, in an all-volunteer environment," H.R.Rep.No.93-857, 93d Cong., 2d Sess.
3 (1974), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1974, pp.
2984, 2985, our review of the legislative history leads us to conclude that the Congress was primarily concerned with reducing government expenditures by more narrowly tailoring the reenlistment bonus scheme to actual military requirements.
See S.Rep.No.93-659, 93d Cong., 2d Sess.
(1973); H.R.Rep.No.93-857, 93d Cong., 2d Sess.
(1974); H.R.Conf.Rep.No.93-985, 93d Cong., 2d Sess.
(1974); U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1974, pp.
2984, 2985.
The Department of Defense specifically recommended the 1974 amendments to Congress as "an opportunity to save money while simultaneously improving our management of reenlistment incentives."
S.Rep.No.93-659, 93d Cong., 2d Sess.
8 (1973); H.R.Rep.No.93-857, 93d Cong., 2d Sess.
9 (1974).
Since there is absolutely no basis in the legislative history to justify a conclusion that Congress was exercising some paramount power enabling it to abrogate existing contract rights, plaintiff Johnson's contractual entitlement to a VRB stands unimpaired after the 1974 amendments.
35 D. The Issue of Rescission of the Extension Agreements The amended complaint, asserting jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) , asked that the Government "be ordered to pay to each of the plaintiffs the bonus provided by his contract and/or the contracts of the plaintiffs be deemed rescinded and declared of no further force and effect ."
App. at 211 (emphasis added).
Plaintiffs now maintain that the District Court erred when it refused to declare the contracts rescinded.
[**46] Rescission is an equitable remedy, and we must keep in mind that courts exercising Tucker Act jurisdiction generally do not have jurisdiction over suits for equitable relief against the United States.
Richardson v. Morris , 409 U.S. 464, 465 , 93 S.Ct. 629 , 34 L.Ed.2d 647 (1973); see Lee v. Thorton , 420 U.S. 139 , 95 S.Ct. 853 , 43 L.Ed.2d 85 (1975).
The Act authorizes jurisdiction only over actions for money judgments.
United States v. King , 395 U.S. 1, 2-3 , 89 S.Ct. 1501 , 23 L.Ed.2d 52 (1969); see United States v. Jones , 131 U.S. 1 , 9 S.Ct. 669 , 33 L.Ed. 90 (1889).
There nevertheless seems to be a narrow "exception" to this limitation on Tucker Act jurisdiction, in that "[w]here the relief is monetary, [courts exercising Tucker Act jurisdiction] can call upon such equitable concepts as rescission and reformation to help .
.
.
reach the right result."
Quinault Allottee Association v. United States , 453 F.2d 1272, 1274 n. 1, 197 Ct.Cl.
134, 138 n. 1 (1972); see United States v. Milliken Imprinting Co. , 202 U.S. 168, 173-74 , 26 S.Ct. 572, 573 , 50 L.Ed. 980, 982 (1906).
We have serious doubts as to whether the plaintiff's request for judicial rescission of their extension contracts falls within this narrow exception since it is hard to conceive of how granting that request would be "in aid of [a money] judgment."
Blanc v. United States , 244 F.2d 708, 709 (2d Cir. 1957).
Compare C. N. Monroe Manufacturing Co. v. United States , 143 F.Supp.
449 (E.D.Mich.1956); Kemp v. United States , 38 F.Supp.
568 (D.Md.1941).
See also Universal Transistor Products Corp. v. United States , 214 F.Supp.
486 (E.D.N.Y.1963).
We find it unnecessary to resolve these doubts one way or the other, however, since on the basis of the record before us we would find it impossible to sustain a judicial decree of rescission.
The payment of VRBs to the plaintiffs is an adequate legal remedy, and we have been offered no evidence indicating that there are exceptional circumstances in this case that justify the grant of equitable relief.
We therefore conclude that the District Court properly limited the relief in this case to the award of VRBs.
III.
CLASS ACTION ISSUES On September 28, 1973, in the same order granting plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, the District Court certified this suit as a class action under Rule 23(b)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
36 The Government argues on [**47] this appeal that the District Court erred in certifying this suit as a class action because it did not make its class action determination "as soon as practicable after the commencement" of the action as required by Rule 23(c)(1).
The Government also presses the argument that due process required personal prejudgment notice to the easily identifiable members of this Rule 23(b)(1) class, and that the failure of the District Court to order such notice consequently requires reversal of the class action certification.
Plaintiffs, who had asked the District Court to order the Government to disclose the names and addresses of members of the class, challenge on appeal the refusal of the District Court to honor that request.
37 A. The Requirements of Rule 25(c)(1) Rule 23(c)(1) provides: The Government argues that the District Court's class action certification must be reversed as inconsistent with Rule 23(c)(1) in that the District Court "did not make a class action determination until the entry of final judgment, some six months after the action commenced."
Brief at 25-26.
Clearly, a District Court cannot simultaneously certify an action under Rule 23(b)(3) and enter a final judgment in the action since Rule 23(c)(2) 38 expressly requires [**48] prejudgment notice to the absent members of a Rule 23(b)(3) class concerning, among other things, their opportunity to "opt out" of the class.
39 See Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin , 417 U.S. 156, 173-77 , 94 S.Ct. 2140 , 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974).
But this suit was certified as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(1)(B), and there is nothing in Rule 23 itself requiring prejudgment notice to members of a Rule 23(b)(1)(B) class.
Putting to one side the question of a due process requirement of prejudgment notice to absent members of a Rule 23(b)(1) class, we are left with the question of the precise scope of Rule 23(c)(1)'s procedural requirements.
In that regard, we find persuasive a recent analysis of the issue by Justice (then Judge) Stevens: until Jimenez v. Weinberger , 523 F.2d 689 at 697 (7th Cir. 1975) (emphasis in original).
Applying that analysis to the facts of this case, we do not think that the District Court committed reversible error in simultaneously certifying the case as a class action and entering summary judgment for the plaintiffs.
In the first place, although the Government is correct in stating that the class action was not certified until "some six months after the action commenced," the final certification cannot be considered unreasonably delayed.
Plaintiffs filed this suit on March 30, 1973 "on behalf of themselves and on behalf of all others similarly situated," and they filed a motion to confirm the class on April 23, 1973.
The Government, after requesting two extensions of time, eventually filed its memorandum in opposition to the motion to confirm the class on June 27, 1973.
After the named plaintiffs filed responsive papers in early August, the District Court heard oral argument on plaintiffs' various motions and directed the parties to complete the filing of additional papers by August 24, 1973.
Although the District Court could have been more prompt in certifying the action, we do not consider the September 28, 1973 order untimely.
40 Moreover, absent some showing of actual prejudice either to the Government or to the absent class members, we cannot conclude that the simultaneous entry of the judgment and the class action certification was reversible error.
The only prejudicial factor which the Government suggests in this case is that simultaneous entry of the [**49] orders precludes the prejudgment notice to absent class members that is allegedly required under concepts of due process.
It is to that issue that we now turn.
B. Due Process Notice Requirements This case thrusts us directly into the controversy over the precise prejudgment notice requirements in Rule 23(b)(1) class actions.
41 The express language of Rule 23 requires prejudgment notice only to absent members of a Rule 23(b)(3) class, but a number of courts have concluded that "notice is required as a matter of due process in all representative actions, and 23(c)(2) merely requires a particularized form of notice in 23(b)(3) actions."

Richmond , 386 F.Supp.
151, 158 (E.D.Va.1974).
We note, however, that there is also considerable authority for the position that prejudgment notice to absent class members is not required in actions certified under sections of the Rule other than 23(b)(3).

As the extent of the controversy among the various courts no doubt suggests, the due process issue is a difficult one.
But our review of recent decisions in this and other federal courts indicates that the controversy has diminished considerably after the Supreme Court's decisions in Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin , 417 U.S. 156 , 94 S.Ct. 2140 , 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974) and Sosna v. Iowa , 419 U.S. 393 , 95 S.Ct. 553 , 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975).
The question before the Court in Eisen was whether Rule 23(c)(2), which requires in Rule 23(b)(3) actions "the best notice practicable under the circumstances including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort," was satisfied by notice through publication rather than individual notice to the two and one quarter million easily identifiable members of a Rule 23(b)(3) class.
42 [**50] Noting that the language of the Rule is "unmistakable", the Court held that individual notice is the "best practicable notice" with respect to those class members whose names and addresses are easily identifiable.
At the same time, however, the Court emphasized that it was concerned "only with the notice requirements of subdivision (c)(2)," which is by its terms inapplicable to actions certified under 23(b)(1) or 23(b)(2).
43 417 U.S. at 177 n.14, 94 S.Ct. at 2152 .
Sosna , decided just last Term, provides some firm indication that the Court intends to pursue a different approach to notice problems in actions certified under sections other than 23(b)(3).
Sosna involved a class suit for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of Iowa's durational residency requirement for divorce petitions.
Recognizing that "it [was] contemplated that all members of the class will be bound by the ultimate ruling on the merits," 419 U.S. at 403 , 95 S.Ct. at 559 , the Court first satisfied itself that the conditions of Rule 23(a) had been met.
Id. As to the issue of notice in a Rule 23(b)(2) action, the Court stated in a footnote that "the problems associated with a Rule 23(b)(3) class action, which were considered by this Court last Term [in Eisen ], are not present in this case." Id. at 397 , n.4, 95 S.Ct. at 556 .
Recognizing that the Court seems to have relied primarily on the language of the Rule rather than on constitutional grounds, a number of lower federal courts have concluded that Eisen and Sosna strongly imply that notice is not required in actions brought under subdivisions other than 23(b)(3).
United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum Industries, Inc. , 517 F.2d 826, 878-79 (5th Cir. 1975) (Rules 23(b)(1) and 23(b)(2)); Wetzel v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. , 508 F.2d 239, 255-57 (3d Cir.) (Rule 23(b)(2)), cert. denied , 421 U.S. 1011 , 95 S.Ct. 2415 , 44 L.Ed.2d 679 (1975); Mattern v. Weinberger , 519 F.2d 150, 157-58 (3d Cir. 1975) (Rule 23(b)(2)) ( citing Wetzel , supra ); Molina v. Weinberger , No. 74-1611 (9th Cir. Oct. 1, 1975), slip opinion at 11-14 (Rule 23(b)(2)); e. g. , American Finance System, Inc. v. Harlow , 65 F.R.D. 94 , 110-11 (D.Md.1974) (Rule 23(b)(2)).
Indeed, the Second Circuit has now concluded that prejudgment notice is not required in 23(b)(2) actions, Frost v. Weinberger , 515 F.2d 57, 65 (2d Cir. 1975) (Friendly, J.), see Ives v. W. T. Grant Company , 522 F.2d 749, 764 (2d Cir. 1975), and the Seventh Circuit has indicated that its Schrader opinion will have to be reexamined in light of Eisen , Bijeol v. Benson , 513 F.2d 965, 968 n.3 (7th Cir. 1975).
Our own resolution of the due process claim in a Rule 23(b)(1) action must also [**51] take into account the recent decision by this court in Childs v. United States Board of Parole , 167 U.S.App.D.C.
268 , 511 F.2d 1270 (1974).
The panel in that case, citing the Supreme Court's Eisen decision, upheld the District Court's grant of relief to members of a Rule 23(b)(2) class despite an argument by the Government that the absence of prejudgment notice in that case violated due process.
Id. at 1276 .
We think that a similar resolution of the due process issue should obtain here; the factors that have prompted courts and commentators to conclude that due process does not require notice in Rule 23(b)(2) class actions are equally applicable to actions certified under Rule 23(b)(1).
44 Unlike the situation with respect to members of a Rule 23(b)(3) class, the members of a Rule 23(b)(1) class are likely to be more unified in the sense that there will probably be little interest on the part of individual members in controlling and directing their own separate litigation on the question at issue in the class suit.
Indeed, in a Rule 23(b)(1)(B) class action, adjudications with respect to individual members would as a practical matter dispose of the interests of the absent members or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests.
At best, then, notice provides absent members with an opportunity to monitor the representation of their rights.
In such cases, we think that due process is satisfied if the procedure adopted "fairly insures the protection of the interests of absent parties who are to be bound by it."
Hansberry v. Lee , 311 U.S. 32, 42 , 61 S.Ct. 115, 118 , 85 L.Ed. 22, 27 (1940).
We agree with the Ninth Circuit's recent observation that "[o]nly when the purposes in providing class members an opportunity to signify whether representation by named plaintiffs is fair and adequate or to intervene to present additional claims or to otherwise come into the action to, for example, submit views as amici curiae, are in need of being served, does due process require the direction of some sort of notice to absent members" of a Rule 23(b)(1) class.
Molina v. Weinberger , supra , slip opinion at 13 (Rule 23(b)(2)).
In such cases, notice can be provided pursuant to Rule 23(d)(2).
45 Since in our view this case does not present special circumstances requiring prejudgment [**52] notice, we uphold the District Court's order certifying the class.
C. Disclosure Under Rule 23(d) Plaintiffs argue that the District Court erred in refusing to grant their request for an order directing the Government to disclose the names and addresses of the members of the plaintiff class.
Having considered the context in which this request was made, we cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to issue a Rule 23(d) order.
On May 8, 1973 the attorneys for the named plaintiffs wrote to the United States Attorney's Office stating that "it would be helpful for the Court and plaintiffs if the U.S. Navy were to prepare a list of the names and locations of the plaintiffs [sic] class so that we would be in a position upon Court ruling to notify those members of the class."
The United States Attorney did not respond favorably to the request.
Plaintiffs apparently first mentioned the disclosure issue to the District Court in their opposition to the Government's initial motion for an extension of time in which to respond to the motion to confirm the class.
In their written opposition, plaintiffs mentioned their correspondence with the Government, but failed to request a Rule 23(d) order.
As noted earlier, the Government filed a second motion for an extension of time in which to respond to plaintiffs' motion to confirm the class, and it was in their written opposition to that motion that plaintiffs formally requested an order requiring the Government to disclose the names and addresses of the class members.
No reasons were offered to support that request; plaintiffs simply asked for a disclosure order "in addition" to a requested order fining the Government $500 per day per plaintiff for its continued delay in filing responsive papers.
The judgment entered by the District Court complied in all respects with Rule 23(c) in that it described the members of the plaintiff class.
Absent some articulation of the reasons why plaintiffs thought a disclosure order would be necessary to protect the interests of absent class members, the District Court certainly cannot be said to have abused its discretion in denying the requested order.
IV.
ATTORNEYS' FEES Plaintiffs' counsel asked the District Court to award them attorneys' fees in the amount of $175,000, approximately 25% of their estimate of the total class recovery.
The District Court chose not to follow a percentage of recovery approach and instead relied on the standards for computing attorneys' fees that it had fashioned in Kiser v. Miller , 364 F.Supp.
1311 (D.D.C.1973).
Application of the District Court's Kiser approach to this case produced an award of $14,729.
Shortly after appellate briefs in this case were filed, this court approved the approach which the District Court had taken in Kiser .
Kiser v. Huge , 170 U.S.App.D.C.
407 , at 423-426, 517 F.2d 1237 , at 1253-1256 (D.C.Cir.
1974); 517 F.2d at 1289-93 .
46 Recognizing here, as we did in Kiser , that "we must pay considerable deference to the District Court's exercise of equitable discretion in setting [attorneys'] fees," at 423, 517 F.2d at 1253 ; 517 F.2d at 1289 , we cannot say that the District Court's evaluation of the relevant factors produced an unreasonable, albeit quite modest, award.
The District Court properly withheld calculation of that portion of the attorneys' fees award dealing with the efforts of counsel directed at this appeal, see Kiser , supra, at 425-426 , 517 F.2d at 1255-1256 ; 517 F.2d at 1292 , and we therefore remand the case to the District Court for a determination with respect to that question.
It is so ordered [**53] .
