 PER CURIAM: On February 28 and March 1, 1955, appellant testified at a subcommittee hearing of the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities.
At that hearing he refused to answer certain questions, for which he was convicted for contempt of Congress.
1 That conviction was reversed by the Supreme Court for insufficiency of the indictment.
2 Appellant was then convicted on a new indictment, which alleged refusal to answer six questions asked by the subcommittee.
3 This appeal followed.
Appellant argues that the subcommittee had no proper legislative purpose and that he was not adequately informed by the subcommittee of the legislative pertinency of its questions.
These arguments are foreclosed by Barenblatt v. United States , 360 U.S. 109 , 79 S.Ct. 1081 , 3 L.Ed.2d 1115 (1959).
Appellant further contends that the indictment was insufficient because it did not specifically recite the subcommittee's authority to conduct the investigation here, and that there was no adequate proof at trial of the subcommittee's authority.
We find no merit in these contentions.
There is one serious question presented by this record which appellant has not alleged as grounds for reversal.
At the beginning of the February 28 hearing, appellant's counsel submitted a written motion to the subcommittee contesting its jurisdiction to question appellant.
4 At that time, the subcommittee chairman stated, "You may file the motion; [**128] and then whatever action the committee desires to take upon it, we will take."
No explicit ruling was made on this motion until the conclusion of the March 1 hearing, when the chairman stated: This ruling was made after appellant's refusal to answer the questions for which he was here convicted.
5 Although the subcommittee did specifically direct appellant to answer the questions at issue, its failure specifically to overrule appellant's motion may have left ambiguous whether the sub-committee had considered the objections raised in appellant's motion or whether it was ignorant of them before it directed an answer.
"[A] clear disposition of the witness' objection is a prerequisite to prosecution for contempt *."
Quinn v. United States , 349 U.S. 155, 167 , 75 S.Ct. 668, 675 , 99 L.Ed. 964 (1955).
The subcommittee must "advise the witness of [its] position as to his objections [to give him] a clear choice between standing on his objection and compliance with a committee ruling."
Bart v. United States , 349 U.S. 219, 223 , 75 S.Ct. 712, 714 , 99 L.Ed. 1016 (1955).
6 On the previous appeal, this court ruled, "That [appellant's motion] was in fact denied is clear from the fact that [appellant was] called, sworn and queried."
7 It is not clear whether we are bound by that ruling.
But since appellant's experienced counsel does not challenge that ruling on this [**129] appeal, 8 we are not disposed to consider the matter.
The judgment of the District Court is Affirmed.
