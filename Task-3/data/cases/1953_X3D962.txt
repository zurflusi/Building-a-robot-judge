 PER CURIAM.
This is an attempt to appeal from an order refusing to issue the writ of habeas corpus as prayed for by a prisoner seeking release from State custody were he is held pursuant to State process.
The district judge permitted the appeal in forma pauperis , but declined to issue a certificate of probable cause.
Upon our examination of the record to determine whether such a certificate should be issued and the appeal allowed, we find that the contentions made are without merit.
We, therefore, decline to issue a certificate of probable cause, and accordingly dismiss the appeal.
Dismissed.
