 WILLIAM E. MILLER , Circuit Judge.
The plaintiff, Detroit Local Executive Board, filed this action under 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 185 , 1 seeking to require the defendant, Howard Johnson Company, Inc., to arbitrate grievances that arose during its take-over of a motel and restaurant formerly owned by P. L. Grissom & Son, Inc., and the Belleville Restaurant Company.
On Decembr 7, 1959, the defendant and P. L. Grissom & Son, Inc., entered into a license agreement providing for the operation of a "Howard Johnson Motor Lodge" in Belleville, Michigan.
On August 18, 1960, the defendant entered into an operator's agreement with Ben Bibb, P. L. Grissom, and the Belleville Restaurant Company for the operation of a "Howard Johnson's Restaurant" adjacent to the motor lodge.
On January 1, 1968, the Belleville Restaurant Company and the Hotel & Restaurant Employees & Bartenders International Union entered into a collective bargaining contract affecting the restaurant employees.
On August 1, 1968, P. L. Grissom & Son, Inc., the operator of the motor lodge, entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the Hotel, Motel and Restaurant Employees Union, Local 705, concerning the motel employees.
On June 16, 1972, P. L. Grissom & Son, Inc., Charles Grissom, and the Belleville Restaurant Company 2 sold their interest in the motor lodge and the restaurant to the Howard Johnson Company, Inc. Pursuant to an oral agreement, the transfer date was set for July 24, 1972.
On June 28, 1972, Howard Johnson notified Grissoms that it would not recognize or assume any labor agreements entered into by these companies.
Also Howard Johnson would not assume any obligations or liabilities of the companies resulting from any labor agreements or from unfair labor practices.
On July 9, 1972, Grissoms gave notice to their employees that their employment would be terminated at midnight July 23, 1972.
On July 13, 1972, registered mail notices were sent to the union 3 notifying it of the termination of the business.
Howard Johnson began interviewing prospective employees on July 10, 1972, and the first employees were hired on July 18, 1972.
When Howard Johnson took over the operation of the motel and restaurant, it retained only nine of the restaurant's employees and only one of the motel's employees.
At least 40 employees were permanently replaced.
On July 21, 1972, the plaintiff union instituted this action in state court and obtained a temporary injunction prohibiting Howard Johnson from locking out or terminating the employment of the 40 employees.
The company did not honor the injunction, claiming that it did not receive adequate service and notice.
A hearing was held at the state court level at which the injunction was dissolved, pending a further pretrial hearing.
The defendant filed a petition for removal and the state court pretrial hearing as such was never held.
A hearing was held in federal district court on August 7, 1972, at which time the parties orally agreed on a stipulation of facts.
On August 22, 1972, the district court entered its memorandum, finding for the plaintiff.
4 Notice of appeal was duly filed and the district court granted a stay pending appeal.
The collective bargaining agreement in effect between the motor lodge and the union contained the usual arbitration provisions.
The grievance procedures were in four steps, the fourth step being submission of the grievance to an arbitrator.
5 The arbitration provision provided: Section 2 The agreement also provided: Apparently neither agreement 6 attempted to delineate specifically which types of disputes were arbitrable.
The district court examined in close detail the two leading cases of the Supreme Court applicable to this action, John Wiley & Sons v. Livingston , 376 U.S. 543 , 84 S.Ct. 909 , 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964) and NLRB v. Burns International Security Services, Inc. , 406 U.S. 272 , 92 S.Ct. 1571 , 32 L.Ed.2d 61 (1972).
The district court concluded that Wiley was more in point than Burns and consequently that the defendant should be required to arbitrate.
7 This finding was premised on the conclusion that Howard Johnson was a successor employer, and therefore, under Wiley should be required to honor the arbitration clause of the Grissoms' collective bargaining agreements with the union.
The district court left to the arbitrator the decision as to which provisions of the agreements should be applicable to Howard Johnson.
The first question we must face is whether Howard Johnson is a successor employer.
The Court in Wiley said: 376 U.S. at 551 84 S.Ct. at 915 In Burns the Court cited with approval a number of court decisions enforcing orders of the NLRB delineating a number of factors to consider in determining whether there is a "continuity of interest" so that the purchaser of a business is a successor.
These factors include: the prior and subsequent structure of the business operation, NLRB v. Zayre Corp. , 424 F.2d 1159, 1163 (5th Cir. 1970); S. S. Kresge Co. v. NLRB , 416 F.2d 1225 (6th Cir. 1969), the location of the operation, NLRB v. Zayre , supra ; S. S. Kresge v. NLRB , supra ; NLRB v. McFarland , 306 F.2d 219 (10th Cir. 1962), and the identity of the employees and the nature of the work, NLRB v. Zayre , supra , Tom-A-Hawk Transit, Inc. v. NLRB , 419 F.2d 1025 (7th Cir. 1969).
8 Howard Johnson argues that the controlling factor in all successorship cases is whether the new owner hired a majority of the old owner's employees.
For support it points to the Court's language in Burns .
if a majority of employees after the change of ownership or management were employed by the preceding employer 406 U.S. at 279 92 S.Ct. at 1577 Also: 8 (a) (5) 9 (a) 406 U.S. at 281 92 S.Ct. at 1579 Moreover, Howard Johnson points to this court's decisions in NLRB v. Interstate 65 Corp. , 453 F.2d 269 (6th Cir. 1971) and NLRB v. Wayne Convalescent Center , 465 F.2d 1039 (6th Cir. 1972).
Both of these decisions placed great reliance on the hiring of enough of the predecessor's employees to constitute a majority of the successor's work force in finding successorship status.
On the other hand, the absence of the hiring of a majority of the predecessor's employees may lead to the refusal to find successorship status.
See NLRB v. John Stepp's Friendly Ford, Inc. , 338 F.2d 833 (9th Cir. 1964).
Apparently the same considerations apply to actions under 301 of the LMRA.
In Wackenhut Corp. v. International Union, United Plant Guards , 332 F.2d 954 (9th Cir. 1964), the Ninth Circuit placed major reliance on the hiring of substantially all of the predecessor's employees to find successorship status.
The Court there also followed Wiley and required the successor employer to abide by the substantive terms of the collective bargaining agreements as determined by an arbitrator.
In Printing Specialties & Paper Products Union v. Pride Papers Aaronson Bros. Paper Corp. , 445 F.2d 361 (2nd Cir. 1971), the Second Circuit refused to find successorship in an action under 301 .
The Court stated: "The fact that no [predecessor's] employees worked at the new enterprise is most compelling evidence of lack of substantial continuity in the business enterprise."
445 F.2d at 363-364 .
Only one case has been brought to our attention finding successorship in a 301 action where the successor did not hire a majority of the predecessor's employees.
In Monroe Sander Corp. v. Livingston , 377 F.2d 6 (2nd Cir. 1967), the Second Circuit held that where a parent company terminated the employees of a subsidiary in order to continue the same functions at a newly purchased operation, the parent could be required to arbitrate, as a successor, the termination of the subsidiary's employees.
In the case before us, the district court held that although Howard Johnson did not hire a majority of Grissoms' employees, it could nevertheless be required to arbitrate as a successor.
The court found considerable continuity of interest between the new and old businesses.
It pointed out that substantially all of the assets of Grissoms were purchased, that the location and identity of the businesses remained exactly the same, that there was only a one minute hiatus in the operation of the enterprises at the time of the transfer, and that many of the products and services were identical.
Relying on these factors the district court viewed Howard Johnson as a successor.
We agree with this conclusion.
In addition to the criteria relied upon by the district court, the franchising agreements between Grissoms and Howard Johnson included extensive reservations by Howard Johnson over the operation of the motel and the restaurant, evidencing the close control it possessed over the management and activities of both operations.
Also the motel bargaining agreement itself contained a successorship clause.
9 Furthermore, we do not deem the refusal to hire a majority of Grissoms' employees to preclude the finding of successorship, at least in this 301 action.
Howard Johnson's argument here attempts to pull itself up by its own bootstraps.
It argues that it need not arbitrate the refusal to hire Grissoms' employees because it is not a successor.
It is 'not a successor, because it did not hire a majority of Grissoms' employees.
Also to adopt the position urged by Howard Johnson would make the employees' jobs completely contingent on the employer's desire either to retain or to disregard the collective bargaining agreements.
If Howard Johnson sought to retain the agreement negotiated by Grissoms, it would hire a majority of Grissoms' employees.
If, on the other hand, it wished to disregard the collective bargaining agreement, it would simply hire none or at best only a few of the former employees.
The decision whether to hire the predecessor's employees should turn upon other and more relevant considerations.
10 Since we determine that Howard Johnson is a successor employer, we must decide whether such status carries with it the obligation to arbitrate under the collective bargaining agreements.
In Wiley the Supreme Court held that collective bargaining agreements under federal labor law must be interpreted differently than other contracts as construed under common law principles.
Accordingly, the Court held that the arbitration provisions are binding on a successor employer even though it was not a party to the collective bargaining agreement.
Following Wiley several circuits have held that a successor employer in 301 actions could be bound by the substantive terms of the previously negotiated collective bargaining agreement if appropriate under the arbitrator's award.
See, e. g. , Wackenhut Corp. v. International Union, United Plant Guards , supra ; United States Gypsum Co. v. United Steelworkers of America , 384 F.2d 38 (5th Cir. 1967); Monroe Sander Corp. v. Livingston , supra .
Howard Johnson, however, argues that the Supreme Court's decision in Burns that a successor employer does not violate 8(a)(5) when it refuses to honor any of the substantive terms of the predecessor's collective bargaining agreement, also precludes an arbitrator from requiring a successor to honor any of the terms of the previous agreement.
We do not feel that Burns requires such a result.
In Wiley the Court stated: Warrior & Gulf supra 363 U.S.] at 580 80 S.Ct. at 1352 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 376 U.S. at 549 84 S.Ct. at 914 Nothing in Burns in our opinion alters this reflection of national policy.
It is true that in Burns the Court said: 406 U.S. at 287-288 92 S.Ct. at 1582 Furthermore, the Court criticized the Board's position that the successor is bound by all the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.
It said: 406 U.S. at 288-289 92 S.Ct. at 1582 At first glance this language appears to cast doubts on the continued validity of Wiley .
We do not feel, however, that the Court intended to eviscerate Wiley .
The two cases are not irreconcilable.
In Burns the Supreme Court distinguished Wiley on three grounds.
First, the Court noted that Wiley arose in the context of a Sec. 301 action for arbitration, while Burns arose in the context of a Sec. 8(a)(5) proceeding where the National Labor Relations Board is "expressly limited by the provisions of Sec.
8(d)."
11 406 U.S. at 285 , 92 S.Ct. at 1581 .
Second, the Court noted that Wiley was limited to an arbitration order while in Burns the Board found the company in violation of Sec. 8(a)(5) for refusing to bargain with the union in not honoring the substantive provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.
Third, Wiley involved a merger occurring against the background of state law, while in Burns the two companies were competitors and had no prior dealings.
The first and second distinctions presented by the Court are convincing that Burns does not preclude arbitration in the situation before us.
Traditionally, arbitrators have been accorded wide flexibility in interpreting collective bargaining agreements.
In Wiley the Court's limited holding was that the successor employer was under a duty to arbitrate grievances, the scope and extent of the duty being governed by the collective bargaining agreement.
The Court avoided any expression of views as to the merits of the substantive matters of arbitration.
Since Wiley arbitration awards have taken into account altered conditions created by a change of employers, although of course the arbitrator's authority must come from the collective bargaining agreement itself.
As stated by the Third Circuit in United Steelworkers of America v. Reliance Universal, Inc. , 335 F.2d 891, 895 (3rd Cir. 1964): The NLRB in its Burns decision had adopted an all-or-nothing approach.
If the employer was a successor then it was required to honor all of the terms of the predecessor's agreement.
If not a successor, it did not have to honor any part of the predecessor's agreement.
Burns Int'l.
Services, Inc. , 182 NLRB 348 (1970).
Apparently the Board felt that it was barred from taking a middle ground by requiring the successor to honor selective portions of the agreement by the Supreme Court's ruling in H. K. Porter Co. v. NLRB , 397 U.S. 99 , 90 S.Ct. 821 , 25 L.Ed.2d 146 (1970).
As noted by the Supreme Court in Burns the Board's position would lead to rigidity in labor relations.
This factor we feel is primarily the Supreme Court's reason for rejection of the Board's position.
12 In arbitration proceedings as ordered below such rigidity is not present.
Also we feel that our holding is in accordance with the national policy of the settlement of labor disputes by arbitration rather than by a contest of strength between the parties.
See , United Steel Workers of America v. American Manufacturing Co. , 363 U.S. 564 , 80 S.Ct. 1343 , 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1960); United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior & Gulf Navigation Co. , 363 U.S. 574 , 80 S.Ct. 1347 , 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960); United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp. , 363 U.S. 593 , 80 S.Ct. 1358 , 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960).
We do not feel that such a role was vitiated by Burns .
13 Finally, we must note that nothing in our opinion should be taken as an expression on the merits of the respective complaints before the arbitrator.
As stated by the Fifth Circuit in International Ass'n of Machinists v. Hayes Corp. , 296 F.2d 238, 244 (5th Cir. 1961): In accordance with the foregoing the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
