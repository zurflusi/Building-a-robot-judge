 PER CURIAM Opinion Text Erich E. Schleier received a settlement for back pay and liquidated damages under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. Sections 621-34 .
Schleier and his wife, Helen B., paid federal income taxes on the back pay but not on the liquidated damages.
The government issued a statutory notice of deficiency for failure to pay taxes on the liquidated damages.
The Schleiers responded that they were entitled to a refund for the taxes they paid on the back pay.
The United States Tax Court concluded that the entire settlement under the ADEA was excludable from Schleier's income pursuant to Section 104(a)(2) .
The government appeals.
We have already decided the issue.
Money recovered under the ADEA is excludable from income for the purposes of taxation.
Purcell v. Sequin State Bank and Trust Co., 999 F.2d 950 [ 62 FEP Cases 1336 ] (5th Cir. 1993 ).
We AFFIRM.
