 PER CURIAM.
Defendant was retried following the reversal reported in Durham v. United States , 403 F.2d 190 (9th Cir. 1968), and was again convicted.
His sole contention on this appeal is that the discovery of the wallet on May 7 was the fruit of an unlawful search conducted two days earlier.
There is nothing in the present record, however, to change our conclusion on the prior appeal that "[i]f the unlawful search or questioning of appellant [on May 5] contributed in any degree to the ultimate seizure of his wallet, its role must be considered de minimis."
Id. at 196 .
Defendant points out that, but for the negligence of the government agents, the wallet would have been found in the unlawful May 5 search, and would have been subject to suppression.
He argues that to admit the wallet in evidence therefore enables the government to take advantage of its "own wrong" ( Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States , 251 U.S. 385, 392 , 40 S.Ct. 182 , 64 L.Ed. 319 (1920)), namely, its failure to conduct the unlawful search of May 5 effectively.
The contention is without merit.
The "wrong" to which Justice Holmes referred in Silverthorne was a search which violated the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.
The exclusionary rule is not applicable to the wallet because it was not discovered as a result of such a violation.
Affirmed.
