 ROBB , Circuit Judge: In this case Philip Agee challenges a regulation relied on by the United States Department of State to revoke his passport.
The District Court, 483 F.Supp.
729 , declared the regulation invalid for lack of congressional authorization and restored the passport.
We affirm.
Appellee Philip Agee, a United States citizen and a former employee of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), presently resides in Hamburg, West Germany.
Agee is a leading critic of the CIA's clandestine operations throughout the world.
He has written and spoken extensively attacking American intelligence efforts, and has purportedly revealed the identities of certain undercover CIA agents.
Agee was issued a United States passport, No. Z3007741, on March 30, 1978, with an expiration date of March 29, 1983.
However, the United States Department of State, aware of Agee's activities and perhaps believing that they took on special significance because of the Iranian crisis 1 and the recent unrest in other Islamic countries, moved to revoke his passport.
On December 23, 1979 the United States Consul General in Hamburg delivered to Agee a letter from the Department of State notifying him that his passport was immediately revoked and should be surrendered.
The letter invoked the authority of 22 C.F.R. 51.70(b)(4) & 51.71(a) (1979).
22 C.F.R. 51.70(b)(4) (1979) provides: [**48] 22 C.F.R. 51.71(a) (1979) states: 51.70 According to the State Department letter Section 51.70(b) (J.A.
at 13).
The letter also informed Agee of his right to administrative review, and the Department of State subsequently offered him a hearing on an expedited basis.
Agee rejected this option, however, and on December 31, 1979, he sued Cyrus Vance, who was then Secretary of State, in the District Court.
The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief.
Agee's complaint challenged the revocation of his passport on five grounds: (1) that 22 C.F.R. 51.70(b)(4) has not been authorized by Congress and is therefore invalid; (2) that 22 C.F.R. 51.70(b)(4) is impermissibly vague and overbroad; (3) that the revocation of his passport prior to a hearing violated his Fifth Amendment right to procedural due process; (4) that the revocation of his passport violated his right to travel--a liberty interest protected by the Fifth Amendment; and (5) that his passport was revoked in order to punish him and suppress his criticism of government policy in violation of the First Amendment.
In proceedings before the District Court on January 3, 1980, Agee's counsel, for the purposes of attacking the Secretary's authority to adopt and apply 22 C.F.R. 51.70(b)(4) , conceded the truth of "the charges as they are made in the letter to Agee."
(Tr. at 16).
On January 18, 1980 the case was orally argued to the District Court on cross-motions for summary judgment.
By Memorandum and Order dated January 28, 1980 the District Court granted summary judgment to Agee and ordered the restoration of his passport.
The District Court concluded that "[t]he Secretary of State's power to revoke or limit a passport flows from Congress not from the President" and "[h]is power is no greater than Congress may choose to delegate to him."
Accordingly the court held that 22 C.F.R. 51.70(b)(4) is invalid because "the Secretary's promulgation of the challenged regulation was without [express or implied] authorization from Congress."
On January 29, 1980 the Secretary of State filed a notice of appeal from the District Court's decision, and by Orders dated February 4 and 5, 1980 this court granted the Secretary's motion for a stay pending appeal.
As authority to promulgate and enforce 22 C.F.R. 51.70(b)(4) , the Secretary of State relies on the Passport Act of 1926, 22 U.S.C. 211a (1976), which at the time the regulation was adopted in 1968 provided that: [**49] 2 In Kent v. Dulles , 357 U.S. 116 , 78 S.Ct. 1113 , 2 L.Ed.2d 1204 (1958), the Secretary of State had denied two passport applications pursuant to a regulation promulgated in reliance on 22 U.S.C. 211a .
The regulation prohibited the issuance of passports to members of the Communist Party or to persons who "engage in activities which support the Communist movement" or "are going abroad to engage in activities which will advance the Communist movement for the purpose, knowingly and wilfully of advancing that movement."
Id. at 117-18 n.1, 78 S.Ct. at 1114 n.1.
The Supreme Court held that "[t]he right to travel is a part of the 'liberty' of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment," and, therefore, "[i]f that 'liberty' is to be regulated, it must be pursuant to the law-making functions of the Congress."
Id. at 125, 129 , 78 S.Ct. at 1118, 1120 .
Further, the Court stated that it would "construe narrowly all delegated powers that curtail or dilute [the right to travel]."
Id. at 129 , 78 S.Ct. at 1120 .
The Court held that Congress did not give the Secretary of State "unbridled discretion to grant or withhold a passport from a citizen for any substantive reason he may choose", and that the only grounds for refusing a passport "which it could fairly be argued were adopted by Congress in light of prior administrative practice" were "relate[d] to citizenship or allegiance on the one hand or to criminal or unlawful conduct on the other."
Id. at 127-128 , 78 S.Ct. at 1119 .
The Court explained that: 32 Stat. 386 22 U.S.C. 212 Id. at 127 , 78 S.Ct. at 1119 .
Thus, the Court, observing that the State Department rulings concerning Communists were "scattered" and "not consistently of one pattern", concluded that the regulation employed to deny passports to members and supporters of the Communist Party lacked congressional authorization and was therefore invalid.
Id. at 128-30 , 78 S.Ct. at 1119-1120 .
In Zemel v. Rusk , 381 U.S. 1 , 85 S.Ct. 1271 , 14 L.Ed.2d 179 (1965), the Supreme Court considered the validity of an area travel ban imposed by the Secretary of State to prohibit travel to Cuba by all United States citizens.
The Court reasoned that the language of 22 U.S.C. 211a "is surely broad enough to authorize area restrictions, and there is no legislative history indicating an intent to exclude such restrictions from [**50] the grant of authority."
Id. at 8 , 85 S.Ct. at 1276 .
Noting that area restrictions were imposed on numerous occasions both before and after the Passport Act was adopted in 1926, the Court held that the ban on travel to Cuba was valid because there was "an administrative practice sufficiently substantial and consistent to warrant the conclusion that Congress had implicitly approved it."
Id. at 8-12 , 85 S.Ct. at 1279 .
In addition, the Court stated that, unlike the denial of the passport applications in Kent v. Dulles , supra , "the Secretary has refused to validate appellant's passport not because of any characteristic peculiar to appellant [i.e., political beliefs or associations], but rather because of foreign policy considerations affecting all citizens."
Id. at 13 , 3 85 S.Ct. at 1279 .
This court has also considered the issue of congressional authorization for administrative actions impacting on the right of international travel.
In Woodward v. Rogers , 344 F.Supp.
974 (D.D.C.1972), aff'd without opinion , 159 U.S.App.D.C.
57 , 486 F.2d 1317 (1973), this court summarily affirmed the District Court's holding that there existed neither explicit nor implicit statutory authority for requiring an oath of allegiance as a prerequisite to the issuance of a passport.
The District Court said: [**51] 344 F.Supp.
at 985 .
In Lynd v. Rusk , 128 U.S.App.D.C.
399 , 389 F.2d 940 (1967), this court held that the Secretary of State could not withhold a citizen's passport for failure to give assurance that he would not travel without a passport to those countries where the Secretary had designated travel to be inimical to the nation's foreign policy.
The court reasoned that "[a]lthough Congress has approved administrative action intended to limit travel to restricted areas through the means of restricting passports, .
.
.
it has not made travel to restricted areas a crime and added possible deprivation of liberty as a sanction for achieving this objective"; and thus the court concluded that there was no "basis for inferring that Congress has given the Secretary the authority to deny legitimate, constitutionally protected travel, merely because that is a technique which provides greater assurance of hindering travel to designated areas."
128 U.S.App.D.C.
at 405 , 389 F.2d at 946-947 .
In summary, as the case law makes clear, the Secretary of State must demonstrate that Congress has authorized 22 C.F.R. 51.70(b)(4) either by an express delegation or by a "sufficiently substantial and consistent" administrative practice to warrant finding the implied approval of Congress.
The Secretary argues that the Passport Act of 1926, 22 U.S.C. 211a , interpreted consistently with the President's power to protect national security and conduct foreign affairs, authorizes the revocation of Agee's passport under 22 C.F.R. 51.70(b)(4) , especially in light of Agee's concession for purposes of his summary judgment motion that his activities seriously damage the national security and the foreign policy of the United States.
However, the Passport Act does not expressly authorize the Secretary to deny or revoke a passport on national security or foreign policy grounds, and no subsequent legislation relating to passports has explicitly delegated such authority.
In fact, in 1958 and in 1966 the Department of State unsuccessfully sought this precise power from Congress, 4 and in 1978 Congress limited the Secretary's discretion, as upheld in Zemel v. Rusk , supra , to impose area restrictions on travel.
5 To be sure the failure to enact the legislation sought by the Department of State and the contraction of executive power over area restrictions do not conclusively signify congressional disapproval of 22 C.F.R. 51.70(b)(4) ; but neither do they support the Secretary's construction of 22 U.S.C. 211a as a broad delegation of authority to regulate.
Moreover, with regard to the inherent foreign affairs power of the executive, the [**52] Supreme Court emphasized in Baker v. Carr , 369 U.S. 186, 211 , 82 S.Ct. 691, 707 , 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962), that "it is error to suppose that every case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance", and we reaffirm what this court stated in Lynd v. Rusk , supra : Zemel Kent v. Dulles 357 U.S. 116, at 129 78 S.Ct. at 1119 2 L.Ed.2d 1204 128 U.S.App.D.C.
at 403 , 389 F.2d at 944 .
The Secretary contends that past administrative and legislative practice also confirms congressional approval of his authority to deny or revoke passports on the basis of "serious damage to the national security or the foreign policy of the United States."
However, the Secretary details only one instance in twelve years in which 22 C.F.R. 51.70(b)(4) was employed to revoke a passport, 6 and only five refusals of passport applications, two prior to the passage of the Passport Act of 1926 and three during the mid-1950's, which were even arguably for national security or foreign policy reasons.
7 Regardless of whether Congress was aware of these scattered examples when it adopted the Passport Act in 1926 and other travel control legislation in 1941, 1952, and 1978, such evidence hardly amounts to a "substantial and consistent administrative practice" demonstrating implied congressional authorization for the challenged regulation.
Until Agee's case arose 22 C.F.R. 51.70(b)(4) ) was virtually unused.
In addition, the Secretary relies on a series of statutes, regulations, proclamations, orders and advisory opinions dating back to 1856, most of which concern the power of the executive to refuse passports to persons engaged in criminal conduct and to restrict or condition the issuance of passports during time of war or national emergency; 8 [**53] but such measures are inapposite and unpersuasive on the issue of implicit authority to invoke national security or foreign policy considerations during peacetime.
See Kent v. Dulles , supra , 357 U.S. at 128 , 78 S.Ct. at 1119 .
Further, as illustrated by the Supreme Court's decisions in Kent v. Dulles , supra at 127 , 78 S.Ct. at 1118 , and Zemel v. Rusk , supra 381 U.S. at 8 , 85 S.Ct. at 1276 , the criterion for establishing congressional assent by inaction is the actual imposition of sanctions and not the mere assertion of power.
"[O]nly the clearest .
.
.
evidence [of past administrative and legislative practice] will permit this Court to consider Congressional silence to be a substitute for explicit and affirmative legislative action in limiting the free exercise of important rights."
Woodward v. Rogers , 344 F.Supp.
at 985 .
Such proof is lacking here.
We conclude that 22 C.F.R. 51.70(b)(4) was promulgated by the Secretary of State and enforced against Agee without the requisite express or implied authorization of Congress.
9 The Secretary may not revoke Agee's passport unless Congress has authorized him to do so, for "the right to travel abroad" is constitutionally protected and subject to regulation only "pursuant to the law-making functions of the Congress."
See Aptheker v. Secretary of State , 378 U.S. 500, 505 , 84 S.Ct. 1659, 1663 , 12 L.Ed.2d 992 (1964); Kent v. Dulles , supra 357 U.S. at 129 , 78 S.Ct. at 1119 .
The decisions of the Supreme Court would permit the revocation of Agee's passport if he were indicted or otherwise charged with criminal conduct, 10 but he has not been charged with any violation of law.
The State Department's letter revoking his passport makes no such charge.
Under the decisions it is not enough, absent a formal allegation of criminal activity, that Agee's conduct may be considered by some to border on treason.
We are bound by the law as we find it.
The judgment of the District Court declaring 22 C.F.R. 51.70(b)(4) invalid and ordering the restoration of Agee's passport is affirmed, and the stay pending appeal is vacated.
So ordered .
