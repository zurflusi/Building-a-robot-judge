 PER CURIAM.
The court below, 89 F.Supp.
575 , lacked jurisdiction of the person of the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization and hence acquired no power to adjudicate the issues.
We ruled to this effect in Podovinnikoff v. Miller , 3 Cir., 179 F.2d 937 .
See also Connor v. Miller , 2 Cir., 178 F.2d 755 .
It follows that the court below committed no error in entering the order complained of.
Accordingly it will be affirmed.
