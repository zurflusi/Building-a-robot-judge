 MATHEWS , Circuit Judge.
This is a petition brought by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to review a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals holding that respondent's income tax liability for the year 1930 was $330.98 less than the Commissioner had determined it to be.
The facts are as follows: Respondent owned 165 shares of the preferred stock of Columbia Steel Corporation, some of which she purchased in 1924 and some in 1926.
The total price paid by respondent for her stock was $14,996.11.
The corporation's articles of incorporation provided that holders of its preferred stock should receive annually, as dividends thereon, $7 per share in cash or, at the option of the corporation, one share of its common stock for each share of preferred.
The articles further provided that dividends on the preferred stock should be paid in full before any dividends should be paid or payable on the common.
All voting rights pertained to the common stock, none to the preferred.
In each of the years 1925, 1926, 1927, and 1928, the corporation had a surplus sufficient to pay the preferred dividends in cash, but elected to pay them, and did pay them, in common stock, as authorized by its articles.
Respondent received in those years an aggregate of 524 shares of common stock as dividends on her preferred stock.
In 1930 the corporation redeemed its preferred stock at $105 per share; respondent receiving for her 165 shares $17,325.
In computing the profit realized by respondent, the Commissioner adjusted the cost basis of respondent's preferred stock by apportioning the $14,996.11 which she paid therefor between that stock and the common stock received by her as dividends thereon, in proportion to their respective values, thereby reducing the cost basis of respondent's preferred stock to $11,505.80.
Thus computed, the profit realized by respondent was $5,819.20.
The Board of Tax Appeals held that the adjustment made by the Commissioner was improper; that the proper cost basis of respondent's preferred stock was the $14,996.11 which she paid therefor, and that, consequently, the profit realized therefrom was only $2,328.89.
The effect of this holding is to reduce respondent's tax liability for the year 1930 to an amount $330.98 below that determined by the Commissioner.
The Commissioner assigns this holding as error, and contends here, as he did below, that his adjustment of the cost basis of respondent's preferred stock was proper and should be upheld.
The propriety of this adjustment is determined by the character of the dividends paid in common stock of the corporation to holders of its preferred stock.
It is conceded that, if these dividends were taxable income, the adjustment was improper, and the Board's decision should be affirmed.
It is also conceded, as it must be, that, if these were stock dividends, they were not taxable income.
In the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 201 (f), 43 Stat. 254 , 255, in the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 201 (f), 44 Stat. 10 , 11, and in the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 115 (f), 45 Stat. 822 , it was provided that: "A stock dividend shall not be subject to tax."
Thus the first question to be decided is whether the common stock received by respondent as dividends on her preferred stock did or did not constitute stock dividends.
Respondent admits that, when she received these dividends, she thought they were stock dividends, treated them as such, never reported them as income and never paid taxes on them, but she now says she was wrong in so thinking and so acting.
She now contends that these were not stock dividends, because they were paid in common stock, whereas the stock on which they were paid was preferred stock.
Whether this circumstance excludes them from the category of stock dividends is the question now to be considered.
In Thompson on Corporations (3d Ed.) vol. 7, p. 137, 5263, it is stated that "a stock dividend is what the term itself implies, a distribution of the stock of the corporation among the stockholders as a dividend."
Other definitions are: "A dividend made payable by a corporation in new or unissued shares of its own stock."
(14 C.J.
812); "one paid in stock, that is, not in money, but in a proportional number of shares of the capital stock of the company, which is ordinarily increased for this purpose to a corresponding extent" (Black's Law Dictionary [2d Ed.] p. 383).
In none of these definitions is there any suggestion that, in order to constitute a stock dividend, the stock distributed and the stock already held must be of the same class.
The term "stock dividend" is not defined in the Revenue Acts, but the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder have uniformly treated it as embracing any stock issued by a corporation as a dividend to its stockholders, regardless of whether the stock so issued is or is not of the same class as the stock in respect of which it is issued.
Regulations 65 and 69, article 1548; Regulations 74, article 628.
This administrative interpretation is clearly correct.
Even if doubtful, it should be upheld, unless unreasonable or inconsistent with the acts.
Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States , 282 U.S. 375, 378 , 51 S.Ct. 144 , 75 L.Ed. 397 ; Brewster v. Gage , 280 U.S. 327, 336 , 50 S.Ct. 115 , 74 L.Ed. 457 ; Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States , 251 U.S. 342, 349 , 40 S.Ct. 155 , 64 L.Ed. 297 .
It is neither unreasonable nor inconsistent, but is, we think, the only reasonable or consistent interpretation which could have been adopted.
The case of Eisner v. Macomber , 252 U.S. 189 , 40 S.Ct. 189 , 64 L.Ed. 521 , 9 A.L.R. 1570, cited by respondent, does not support her contention.
The question in that case was whether a stock dividend paid in common stock of a corporation to holders of its common stock was income, within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment.
The Supreme Court held that it was not, and that Congress, therefore, had no power to tax it as such.
The question here presented is whether dividends paid in common stock of a corporation to a holder of its preferred stock were stock dividends, within the meaning of the Revenue Acts of 1924, 1926, and 1928.
If so, they were exempt from taxation, whether they were income or not.
The Eisner Case dealt with an act (Revenue Act 1916, c. 463, 2 (a), 39 Stat. 757 ) which attempted, unconstitutionally, to tax all stock dividends.
We are here dealing with Revenue Acts which expressly exempt all stock dividends from taxation.
The question here is, not what Congress could tax, but what it has taxed.
Respondent cites Commissioner v. Tillotson Mfg. Co. (C.C.A.6) 76 F.(2d) 189 , wherein it was held that a dividend paid in common stock of a corporation to holders of its preferred stock was not a stock dividend, within the meaning of the Revenue Act of 1926.
We do not agree with that holding.
It is based upon the erroneous assumption that, in exempting stock dividends from taxation, Congress intended only to exempt those which were already constitutionally exempt.
There is no basis for any such assumption.
Section 201 (f) of the Revenue Act of 1926 declares, without qualification, that a stock dividend shall not be subject to tax.
The Tillotson decision, in effect, adds to this section the words, "provided such dividend is already constitutionally exempt from taxation."
This proviso is not found in the Revenue Acts, and should not be added thereto by judicial construction.
We hold that the term "stock dividend," as used in the Revenue Acts of 1924, 1926, and 1928, embraces all stock dividends, including those paid in common stock of a corporation to holders of its preferred stock.
Whether such dividends constitute income, it is unnecessary to decide.
If they are not income, they are exempt from taxation under the Sixteenth Amendment.
If they are income, they are still exempt by express provisions of these acts.
Respondent contends that, even though the common stock received by her constituted nontaxable stock dividends, it was nevertheless improper for the Commissioner to adjust the cost basis of her preferred stock by apportioning any part of it to the common stock so received.
Her argument is that, under the Sixteenth Amendment, stock dividends of this particular type might have been taxed as income, and that, since they might have been so taxed, they could not be treated as other stock dividends are treated; namely, as merely constituting additional evidence of the stockholder's interest in the corporation.
Respondent's contention must be rejected.
Assuming, without deciding, that Congress might constitutionally have taxed stock dividends of this type, we hold that it was within the power of Congress to exempt such dividends from taxation and to treat them as other stock dividends are treated.
That, we think, is what Congress did in the Revenue Acts of 1924, 1926, and 1928.
In thereby exempting all stock dividends from taxation, Congress, in effect, declared that, for income tax purposes, such dividends, whether income or not, should be treated as merely constituting additional evidence of the stockholder's capital investment.
If so treated when received, such dividends should be so treated, for the purpose of determining gain or loss, when a part of the capital investment is sold or otherwise disposed of.
These and other stock dividends were so treated in Treasury Regulations 74, which were in effect when respondent's preferred stock was redeemed and when her 1930 income tax return was filed.
Article 58 of Regulations 74 provides: " In the case of stock in respect of which any stock dividend was paid, the basis for determining gain or loss from a sale of a share of such stock shall be ascertained in accordance with the principles laid down in article 600.
*" Article 600 provides: "In the case of stock or securities acquired by a shareholder after December 31, 1923, in connection with a transaction [distribution of stock on reorganization] described in section 112 (g) and article 576, the basis in the case of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made shall be apportioned between such stock and the stock or securities distributed to the shareholder.
The basis for the old and new shares shall be determined in accordance with the following rules: "(1) Where the stock distributed in reorganization is all of substantially the same character or preference as the stock in respect of which the distribution is made, the basis of each share will be the quotient of the cost or other basis of the old shares of stock divided by the total number of the old and new shares.
"(2) Where the stock distributed in reorganization is in whole or in part of a character or preference materially different from the stock in respect of which the distribution is made, the cost or other basis of the old shares of stock shall be divided between such old stock and the new stock in proportion, as nearly as may be, to the respective values of each class of stock, old and new, at the time the new shares of stock are distributed, and the basis of each share of stock will be the quotient of the cost or other basis of the class with which such share belongs, divided by the number of shares in the class."
Article 628 of Regulations 74 provides: "The issuance of its own stock by a corporation as a dividend to its shareholders does not result in taxable income to such shareholders, but gain may be derived or loss sustained by the shareholders from the sale of such stock.
The amount of gain derived or loss sustained from the sale of such stock, or from the sale of the stock in respect of which it is issued, shall be determined as provided in articles 561 and 600."
These Regulations were consistent with the Revenue Act of 1928, under which they were promulgated, and were, in our opinion, valid regulations.
They were followed by the Commissioner in adjusting the cost basis of respondent's preferred stock.
That adjustment was proper and should have been upheld.
Though not directly in point, the following cases have some bearing on the questions we have considered and are in accord with the views herein expressed: Miles v. Safe Deposit & Trust Co. , 259 U.S. 247, 253 , 42 S.Ct. 483 , 66 L.Ed. 923 ; Beckers v. United States (Ct.Cl.)
42 F.(2d) 300, 301 ; Hewes v. Eaton (D.C.Conn.)
39 F.(2d) 917, 919 ; Ayer v. Blair , 58 App.D.C.
110 , 25 F.(2d) 534, 535 ; Towne v. McElligott (D.C.S.D.N.Y.)
274 F. 960, 962 .
The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
