 WEICK , Circuit Judge.
This case involves the validity of a chattel mortgage on an automobile as against the claims of the trustee in bankruptcy of the mortgagor.
Prior to bankruptcy, the bankrupt had borrowed money from Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit, Michigan.
To evidence the loan and secure its payment on November 4, 1957 he executed and delivered to the bank a promissory note and chattel mortgage on his 1953 Pontiac automobile.
The proceeds of the loan were disbursed on the following day.
The papers were then forwarded from the bank's branch office, where the loan had been made, to its downtown office for processing and recording of the mortgage.
The chattel mortgage was filed by the bank with the Wayne County Register of Deeds on November 8, 1957.
About five months later, namely, April 18, 1958 the borrower filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy in the District Court upon which an adjudication in Bankruptcy was duly entered.
The referee in bankruptcy held that the mortgage was void as against the trustee in bankruptcy.
The District Judge reversed the order of the referee and the trustee in bankruptcy has appealed to this Court.
The pertinent provision of Michigan Statutes Annotated, 26.929, Comp.Laws 1948, 566.140 , as amended by Public Act 233, September 27, 1957 relating to the recording of chattel mortgages is as follows: The last proviso in the statute is the amendment of September 27, 1957.
Obviously, it has no application to the present case since the chattel mortgage was not a purchase money mortgage.
The Michigan statute has been construed to require the chattel mortgage to be filed immediately with the Register of Deeds.

Unless so filed, the chattel mortgage is void as against creditors who extended credit in the interim between the date of the instrument and its filing for record.

There was no evidence that any creditor had extended credit to the bankrupt between the date of the mortgage and its recording four days later.
Since no creditors had intervened in the present case, the chattel mortgage of the bank was valid and unassailable under Michigan law.
If any imperfection had, existed in the mortgage it had become perfected long before bankruptcy.
The trustee in bankruptcy contends that although unassailable under state law, the chattel mortgage was void by reason of the provisions of Section 70 , subsection c of the Bankruptcy Act 1 which gave to the trustee the status of a perfect hypothetical creditor and, therefore, the case must be considered as if a creditor did exist in the interim period.
The trustee relies on Constance v. Harvey , 2 Cir., 1954, 215 F.2d 571, 575 , certiorari denied 348 U.S. 913 , 75 S.Ct. 294 , 99 L.Ed. 716 , which involved the validity of a chattel mortgage under New York law.
As judicially construed, the New York statute granted a reasonable time to file the mortgage after its execution.
In that case over 10 months had elapsed between the date of the mortgage and its filing for record which the court said was not within a reasonable time.
No creditor, however, had intervened in the interim.
The court held the mortgage void under Section 70 , subsection c of the Bankruptcy Act.
2 The court said: 70 Hoffman v. Cream-O-Products 180 F.2d 649 340 U.S. 815 71 S.Ct. 44 95 L.Ed. 599 The trouble with Constance v. Harvey, in our judgment, was in the retroactive extension of the rights of the trustee in bankruptcy to include those of a creditor which did not in fact exist as of a period almost one year prior to bankruptcy.
The critical time for the accrual of the trustee's rights under Section 70 , sub.
c is "at the date of bankruptcy" not prior thereto.
The trustee can only be "vested as of such date" with the rights of a creditor "then holding a lien whether or not such a creditor actually exists."
This means a creditor at that time and not prior thereto.
Before Constance v. Harvey, it had always been understood that the trustee's rights under Section 70 , sub.
c accrued as of the date of bankruptcy and not earlier.
There is nothing in the section giving to either the trustee or a creditor rights antecedent to bankruptcy.
The rights and remedies of the trustee under Section 70 , subsection e of the Bankruptcy Act to reach fraudulent or otherwise invalid transfers or encumbrances must not be confused with his rights under Section 70 , subsection c. While Section 70 , subsection e would permit a trustee to reach invalid transfers or encumbrances whenever they arose, it would afford no remedy here where the lien of the chattel mortgage had been perfected and was valid against creditors long before bankruptcy.
Section 70 , subsection c gives the trustee the status of a lien creditor as of the date of bankruptcy regardless of whether or not such a creditor existed.
It does not give him or the creditor any status earlier than bankruptcy.
The trustee in bankruptcy is not an innocent purchaser for value.
He takes title to the bankrupt's property subject to all liens, claims and equities existing thereon.
Zartman v. First National Bank , 1910, 216 U.S. 134 , 30 S.Ct. 368 , 54 L.Ed. 418 ; Commercial Credit Co. v. Davidson , 5 Cir., 1940, 112 F.2d 54 ; Hoehn v. McIntosh , 6 Cir., 1940, 110 F.2d 199 ; Hertzberg v. Associates Discount Corp. , 6 Cir., 1959, 272 F.2d 6 .
In fact the trustee, standing in the position of a creditor, holds about the lowest form of security.
Whether or not a valid lien on the bankrupt's property existed is dependent upon the recording laws of the state, Holt v. Crucible Steel Co. , 1912, 224 U.S. 262 , 32 S.Ct. 414 , 56 L.Ed. 756 .
As heretofore pointed out, the chattel mortgage of the bank was valid under Michigan law.
No creditor could have assailed it prior to bankruptcy.
The mortgage was based upon a present consideration.
It was filed for record within a reasonable time after its execution.
The bankrupt received full value.
We see no good reason in this case for extending back retroactively the "strong arm" of the trustee to a period of five months before bankruptcy and invalidating a security valid under state law.
The creditors of the bankrupt's estate are entitled to no such windfall.
The confusion and criticism which followed in the wake of Constance v. Harvey are not conducive to our following the decision.
3 District Judge Picard was right in holding that the chattel mortgage was valid under Michigan law and his judgment is affirmed.
