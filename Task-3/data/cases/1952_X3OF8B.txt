 PER CURIAM.
Upon full consideration of the briefs and arguments on the motion to dismiss, the court is of the opinion that no fact or reason is stated showing that the relief by mandamus is an appropriate remedy.
Without, therefore, determining, or considering on the merits, whether the order complained of was rightly entered, the motion to dismiss the petition, because the relief prayed for is not appropriate, is granted, and the petition is dismissed.
