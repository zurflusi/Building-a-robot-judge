 JONES , Circuit Judge.
Floyd Charles Fallen has attempted to appeal from a judgment and sentence which followed a verdict of guilty returned after a trial in the District Court of the Southern District of Florida sitting in Jacksonville.
Presiding at the trial and imposing the sentence was Judge Albert L. Reeves, a Senior Judge of another District sitting by designation.
The two indictments upon which Fallen was tried and convicted charged a conspiracy, breaking into a post office, and stealing and converting property of the United States.
The two cases were consolidated for trial.
The verdicts finding Fallen guilty were returned on January 11, 1962.
On January 15, 1962, Fallen appeared with his court-appointed counsel for sentencing.
Prior to imposing sentence the judge briefly reviewed and recited the testimony showing that Fallen had participated in the post office robbery, received and took away some of the fruits of that theft, and that his car was used to take some of the stolen property to Tennessee and North Carolina.
The judge reviewed the criminal record of Fallen and called his attention to his statement while on probation that as long as he was on probation he would behave himself but when probation terminated he would go the limit in violating the law.
Sentences aggregating twenty years were imposed.
On the following day, January 16, 1962, Fallen was taken by the United States Marshal to the United States Penitentiary at Atlanta, Georgia.
On January 29, 1962, eighteen days after the verdicts of guilty were returned and fourteen days after sentences were imposed, the Clerk of the District Court received through the mails an envelope containing two letters to the court signed by Fallen.
The envelope bore a Government frank but was not postmarked with a date or otherwise.
Each of the enclosures was dated January 23, 1962.
One of these read: The other was of this tenor: When these papers came into the hands of the Clerk of the Court on January 29, 1962, Judge Reeves had left Jacksonville.
The matter came to the attention of Chief Judge Bryan Simpson who conferred with Mr. Joel S. Moss, who as court-appointed counsel had represented Fallen at the trial.
Mr. Moss, by a letter dated and delivered on January 30, 1962, stated to Judge Simpson that after Fallen was sentenced he and Fallen talked for about an hour and a half and during the conversation Fallen had said that he thought he could raise sufficient funds to pay an attorney to represent him in an appeal, should he decide to take one.
His counsel declined and suggested to Fallen that he secure another attorney without delay so as not to forfeit his right to appeal.
Fallen stated to his counsel that he would procure another attorney.
Mr. Moss concluded his letter with the statement that since the conversation on the day of the sentence he had not represented Fallen.
On February 1, 1962, Judge Simpson entered an order styled "Order with Respect to Notice of Appeal" although in its operation, related primarily to the motion for a new trial.
Because of the need for making reference to this order, it is set out in a footnote.
1 The order directed that a copy of the two Fallen letters, of the letter from Mr. Moss, and of the order, be placed in each of the two cases.
Moss was reappointed to represent Fallen in presenting to Judge Reeves the question of whether the motion for a new trial was timely filed and, if so, whether it should be granted.
The United States Attorney was directed to place the matter before Judge Reeves for consideration and to give notice.
The matter came before Judge Reeves and on February 21, 1962, he entered an order denying the motion for new trial on the merits and expressly declining to rule upon the question as to whether the motion was timely filed.
On the same day, February 21, 1962, a notice of appeal was filed by Mr. Moss.
An affidavit of Fallen was filed in support of an application to appeal in forma pauperis and an order was entered granting the application.
The Government moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that there was no timely filing of a notice of appeal.
Fallen filed, on March 7, 1962, an affidavit reciting that he did not see Mr. Moss between January 11, 1962, the date of his conviction, and January 15, 1962, the date he was sentenced, that he was, after being sentenced, returned to Duval Medical Center in Jacksonville 2 under guard and without visitors, that he was taken to Atlanta on January 16, 1962, where, due to illness and processing he was "unable to write to the court requesting a new trial until the 23rd day of January, 1962."
In order that the expense of the preparation of a record might be avoided in the event the appeal must be dismissed, the cause was specially set on the motion to dismiss, other counsel was appointed to represent Fallen, and the jurisdictional question was argued.
The Rules fix the time within which an appeal can be taken.
They provide: The Court may not enlarge the time for taking an appeal, nor for filing a motion for a new trial.
Rule 45(b) Fed.Rules Crim.Proc., 18 U.S.C.A. The motion for new trial was not filed, nor does it bear a date until after the expiration of the five-day period prescribed by Rule 33, Fed.Rules Crim.Proc., 18 U.S.C.A. The district court should have determined whether or not it had jurisdiction and if it had none it should have dismissed or denied the motion without undertaking to pass upon the merits.
United States v. Corrick , 298 U.S. 435 , 56 S.Ct. 829 , 80 L.Ed. 1263 .
It seems clear that the district court had no jurisdiction to consider the motion since more than twice the permitted time had expired.

337 U.S. 944 , 69 S.Ct. 1500 , 93 L.Ed. 1747 .
Since there was an absence of jurisdiction to consider the motion, the filing of it did not toll nor did the purported ruling upon the merits of it extend the time for filing the notice of appeal.

The Bertone case was followed by this Court in Lott v. United States , 5th Cir. 1960, 280 F.2d 24 , rev. other grounds, 367 U.S. 421 , 81 S.Ct. 1563 , 6 L.Ed.2d 940 .
If we have any jurisdiction to consider and decide the appeal it must be because of the notice of appeal dated January 23, 1962, and received by the Clerk on January 29, 1962, and not by reason of the notice of appeal filed February 21, 1962, after the order on the motion for new trial had been entered.
Although one who has been convicted of a criminal offense has a right to have his conviction reviewed, he must, in order to exercise that right, meet the time requirements of the procedural steps for perfecting his appeal, the first of which is the giving of a timely notice of appeal and without which the Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction.

It has been urged that the district court was required 3 to advise Fallen of his right to appeal.
There is merit in the suggestion if it can be said that the court-appointed counsel, who had stood by Fallen's side and had spoken on his behalf while he was being sentenced, somehow disappeared eo instanti, during the time the sentence was being pronounced so that it could be said that Fallen was not represented by counsel when the court imposed sentence.
The record of the judgments and commitments shows that "On this 15th day of January, 1962, came the attorney for the government and the defendant appeared in person and by counsel, Joel Moss, court appointed *."
Fallen's court-appointed counsel did not think his representation had terminated until the conclusion of the hour and a half conference between attorney and client following the imposition of sentence, as appears from his letter to Judge Simpson.
The Supreme Court, discussing this question, has said: Coppedge v. United States supra There is, we think, no merit in this point.
Williams v. United States , D.C.Cir.1951, 88 App.D.C.

The Rules of Criminal Procedure do not permit, as do the Rules of Civil Procedure, 4 any enlargement of time for taking an appeal because of neglect, excusable or otherwise, or inadvertence.
United States v. Robinson , supra ; United States v. Isabella , 2nd Cir. 1958, 251 F.2d 223 .
The jurisdiction of Courts of Appeal is statutory and if the requirements of the statute are not met the jurisdiction is not invoked.
The rules are designed to fix a definite, ascertainable point in time when litigation shall be at an end unless an appeal has been taken within the prescribed time.

342 U.S. 946 , 72 S.Ct. 560 , 96 L.Ed. 703 .
See Brant v. United States , 5th Cir. 1954, 210 F.2d 470 .
Chief Judge Simpson felt that it was clear from an examination of Tillman v. United States , 5th Cir. 1959, 268 F.2d 422 , that Fallen's letters constituted timely notice of appeal.
In the Tillman case it was held that the timely filing of a petition for leave to appeal in forma pauperis will satisfy the requirement for the timely filing of a notice of appeal.
The judgment of conviction in the Tillman case was entered on June 27, 1958, and the forma pauperis petition was filed the same day.
Having held that the petition would be treated as a notice of appeal the ten-day rule was out of the case. The Supreme Court recognized this principle in Coppedge v. United States , supra , where in a footnote it is said: United States v. Robinson 361 U.S. 220 80 S.Ct. 282 4 L.Ed.2d 259 Among other cases cited to the above case is Tillman v. United States , supra .
The question related to the content of the paper to satisfy the requirement that it be a notice of appeal and was wholly unrelated to the time within which the notice must be filed.
The affidavit of Fallen recites that he was unable to write to the court until January 23, 1962.
He does not say that he then attempted to put it in course of mailing nor does he say when he attempted to do so. Although we think it is wholly immaterial, there is nothing before us to indicate that the authorities at the Atlanta Penitentiary departed from the customary routine of promptly dispatching uncensored and unread, prisoners' mail addressed to a court or court official.
It may be that the removal of Fallen from Jacksonville, where he was tried, to the Atlanta prison on the day following that on which he was sentenced may, to some extent, have delayed the preparation of his notice of appeal, but it does not appear that this prevented a notice of appeal from being filed within the time permitted by the rule.
We do not know that any basis exists for an objection to the removal, without delay, of a convicted prisoner to a place of confinement, or that any enlargement of the time for taking an appeal follows from such removal.
The last day permitted by the Rule for filing the notice of appeal was Thursday, January 25, 1962.
If the last day for filing had been a Saturday and the Clerk's office was closed that day, and if the Clerk had a post office mail box in which the notice of appeal was found on the following Monday, then Fallen might have been entitled to the benefit of a presumption that the notice of appeal was, on the last day for filing, in the box and in the custody of the Clerk so as to meet the requirement.
Reynolds v. United States , 5th Cir. 1961, 288 F.2d 78 , cert. den.
368 U.S. 883 , 82 S.Ct. 127 , 7 L.Ed.2d 83 ; Ward v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co. , 5th Cir. 1959, 265 F.2d 75 , rev. on other grounds, 362 U.S. 396 , 80 S.Ct. 789 , 4 L.Ed.2d 820 .
But, here the Saturday on which it might be presumed the notice of appeal was in the Clerk's post office box was not the last day for filing but two days later.
The most favorable inference that could be drawn or presumption indulged would be that, on the last day for filing, the notice of appeal was somewhere in the possession of the Post Office Department.
Although a more liberal rule may elsewhere prevail, 5 this Court is committed to the principle that the jurisdictional requirement of timely filing of a notice of appeal is not met by the deposit of notice in the mail in time for it to reach the Clerk's office in the usual course of mail delivery within the time allowed.
Ward v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company , supra ; Lejeune v. Midwestern Insurance Co. of Oklahoma City , 5th Cir., 1952, 197 F.2d 149 ; Poyner v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue , 5th Cir. 1936, 81 F.2d 521 .
Although these decisions were applying the Rules of Civil Procedure, there is no basis for a distinction that would make them inapplicable to a case under the Rules of Criminal Procedure.
Fallen does not raise any constitutional questions so we are not required to consider whether Courts of Appeal may, as the Supreme Court does, 6 take jurisdiction of a belated appeal in order to vindicate a constitutional right.
This might be regarded as a hard case. Although the trial judge, Judge Reeves, in imposing sentence, referred to Fallen's record as "a perfect catalogue of crimes," and to Fallen as "a menace to society" who had "repeatedly violated the law," we cannot avoid having sympathy for a man sentenced to twenty years in prison, who is now and will likely, during the remainder of his life, be in a wheel chair.
We must not, however, forget the admonition given by the Supreme Court in its early years, that "Motives of commiseration, from whatever source they flow, must not mingle in the administration of justice."
