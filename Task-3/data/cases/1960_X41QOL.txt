 MERRILL , Circuit Judge.
This case presents the following question: whether gain realized by a taxpayer upon the transfer of his stock in a wholly owned corporation in consideration for voting stock in another corporation plus cash is recognizable in its entirety or only to the extent of the cash received.
The Tax Court, following Howard v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue , 7 Cir., 1956, 238 F.2d 943 , has ruled that the gain is recognizable only to the extent of the cash received.
Grover D. Turnbow , 32 T.C. 646 .
We have concluded that this was error and that the gain is recognizable in its entirety.
The taxpayer, Turnbow, was the sole stockholder of International Dairy Supply Company, a Nevada corporation which had its principal place of business in San Francisco, California.
In 1952, the taxpayer transferred his stock in that company to Foremost Dairies, Inc., a New York corporation which had its principal place of business in Jacksonville, Florida.
This transfer was in exchange for 82,375 shares of the common stock of Foremost and $3,000,000.00 cash, so-called "boot."
The Foremost shares were of a value of $1,235,625.00.
Thus the shares constituted 29% of the total consideration received, while the boot constituted 71%.
The taxpayer reported a capital gain on the transaction limited to the $3,000,000.00 cash boot, less expenses which by agreement he had undertaken to assume.
The Commissioner determined that the entire gain on the transaction was taxable, establishing that gain at $4,163,691.94.
Tax deficiencies for the years 1952 and 1953 in the amounts, respectively, of $264,037.43 and $14,786.26 were determined.
The taxpayer petitioned the Tax Court for review.
That court held that gain on the transaction should be limited to the cash boot.
The deficiencies were disallowed.
The Commissioner has petitioned this court for review.
The problem presented involves construction of 112 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. 112 , which deals with recognition of gain or loss.
Section 112(a) sets forth the general rule that "upon the sale or exchange of property the entire amount of gain or loss shall be recognized, except as hereinafter provided in this section."
Among the exceptions specified, 112 (b) deals with exchanges solely in kind, and 112(b) (3) deals with exchanges of stock for stock on reorganization.
It provides: The term "reorganization," as used in 112(b) (3) , is defined in 112(g) (1) , which, as amended in 1943, provides: In this case we are concerned with the definition set forth in Clause (B) of 112(g) (1) .
Our discussion also deals with the definition set forth in Clause (C).
Today these types of reorganization are known to the tax bar as (B) and (C) reorganizations and we shall take advantage of this terminology.
Section 112(c) is the section upon which the taxpayer relies for his right to limit recognition of gain to the cash boot.
As amended in 1943, 112(c) (1) provides: l l The dispute before us is as to the method to be followed in applying 112 (c) to the facts of a case. The Tax Court purported to follow its earlier decision upon this problem in Luther Bonham, 1936, 33 B.T.A.
1100, 1103-1104 .
It quoted that opinion (supplying its own emphasis) as follows: would be if the item of cash had been omitted Howard v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue , supra , 238 F.2d at page 948 , was also quoted to the following effect: but for 112(g) (1) 112(b) (3) 112(c) (1) Applying this method to the case at bar, the taxpayer reasons: but for the cash received, the transaction--solely stock for stock--would have met the "solely" requirements of both 112(b) (3) and 112(g) (1) (B) and fallen within the nonrecognition provision of 112(b) (3) .
Therefore, he says, under 112(c) the gain to be recognized is limited to the amount of the cash received.
The Commissioner contends that 112(b) (3) requires an actual and not a hypothetical reorganization before nonrecognition can result; that petitioner's method assumes the absence of boot not only to determine whether 112(b) (3) would apply but also to determine whether the 112(g) (1) (B) definition would apply; that this does violence to 112(b) (3) , which expressly contemplates the existence of a reorganization.
The method of applying 112(c) , advocated by the Commissioner, is to ascertain first whether a reorganization exists under 112(g) (1) .
If it does, then and only then can the nonrecognition provisions of 112(b) (3) become applicable.
If it does not, 112(b) (3) cannot apply.
Only when 112(b) (3) applies, can 112(c) operate to modify its consequences.
Applying this method to the case at bar, the Commissioner reasons that, since the presence of boot precludes a (B) reorganization, 112(b) (3) cannot apply and the gain is subject to taxation under 112(a) .
Under the Commissioner's construction, (B) and (C) reorganizations are forever excluded from the operation of 112(c) .
The other types of reorganizations specified in 112(g) (1) , however, do remain subject to the operation of 112(c) .
Upon this dispute, legislative history supports the Commissioner's position.
Prior to 1934, there were no (B) or (C) reorganizations as such.
1 Section 112(i) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 513, (the prior analogous section to 112(g) (1) of the 1934 Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 695) read in pertinent part: The provisions of 112(b) (3) and 112 (c), however, existed in substantially their present form.
The reasons for the 1934 amendment of 112(g) (1) are clearly disclosed by congressional reports and discussion.
The House Ways and Means Committee Report, H.Rep.
No. 704, 73d Congress, 2d Session 13 (1934) states: A letter from the Secretary of the Treasury, which appears in the Congressional Record, 78 Cong.Rec.
2512 (1934) states: A subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, studying the revision of the revenue act, was sufficiently exercised over avoidance practices to give serious consideration to the advisability of eliminating completely the provisions governing reorganization exchanges.
H.
Rep., December 4, 1933, 73d Congress, 2d Session, 8-9 (1933).
However, the House Ways and Means Committee, in its report, stated: The House committee's solution was to eliminate from the definition of reorganization, as it then appeared in Clause (A), the parenthetical phrase following the words "merger or consolidation."
Had this solution been adopted, there would have been no (B) or (C) reorganizations and 112(c) obviously could have no reference to such transactions.
The Senate Finance Committee reported, S.Rep.
No. 558, 73d Congress, 2d Session, 16 (1934): Then follows the Clause (B) definition which was eventually incorporated into 112(g) (1) of the 1934 act.
Emphasizing its views that the tax avoidance problems would be met, the report states at page 17: It is clear from this history that, with specific abuses in mind, Congress sought to eliminate them by requiring that, for an acquisition to qualify for the tax advantages of a reorganization, it must be in exchange solely for voting stock.
With reference to this requirement the Supreme Court has stated in Helvering v. Southwest Consolidated Corporation , 1941, 315 U.S. 194, 198 , 62 S.Ct. 546, 550 , 86 L.Ed. 789 : 112(g) (1) Certainly it could not have been intended by Congress that this result would be frustrated at birth by the already existing provisions of 112(c) ; yet such would seem to be the effect of the taxpayer's construction.
The Commissioner's construction seems supported by subsequent congressional action.
If (B) reorganizations can hypothetically exist notwithstanding boot, the same would apply to today's (C)-type reorganizations, which also were created by the 1934 amendments.
112(g) (1) Yet, in 1939, Congress saw fit to amend the definition of (C) reorganizations by providing: 112 (g) (1) In 368(a) (2) (B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. 368(a) (2) (B), the definition was further amended to provide that only 80% of the assets of the acquired corporation need be obtained in exchange for voting stock; that boot could, without defeating reorganization, be the consideration for assets above 80%.
Under the taxpayer's construction, neither of these amendments was necessary.
That Congress felt it necessary so to amend the section indicates that the Commissioner's construction reflects the true congressional intent and understanding.
The taxpayer refers us to a point emphasized in Howard v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue , supra .
Section 112(e) is the counterpart of 112(c) , the latter dealing with recognition of gains and the former with recognition of losses.
Section 112(e) has remained virtually unchanged since its original enactment as 203(f) of the Revenue Act of 1924.
It provides: l Howard points out that if the presence of boot results in recognition of gains it likewise results in recognition of losses; that a taxpayer desiring that a loss be recognized might convert what otherwise would be a legitimate reorganization into a sale by the payment of a trifling amount of cash; that such a construction would thus defeat the 1924 legislative intent in enacting 112(e) .
It would appear, however, that Congress in 1934 was aware that attempts might be made under the proposed amendment to secure recognition of losses notwithstanding actual continuity of interest.
The House Ways and Means Committee, as we have noted, recommended that the "acquisition" type of transaction (the forerunner of today's (B) and (C) reorganizations) be completely eliminated from the definition of reorganization.
At the same time the report stated: Thus it would appear that in the judgment of Congress the danger of tax avoidance (through securing recognition of losses notwithstanding continuity of interest) was avoided by the probability that the acquisitions resulting in loss could be treated as reorganizations under the remaining provisions of 112 (g) (1) .
2 Whether this judgment was sound apparently still remains to be tested.
However, Congress would seem to have weighed the desirable features of the proposed amendment (as to gains) against its undesirable potentialities (as to losses).
For us to permit the possibility of tax avoidance under 112(e) , to control our construction of 112(c) , would be to overrule the apparent judgment of Congress upon this very question.
The Tax Court opinion in this case points out that the Commissioner's regulations are deemed to have received the approval of Congress (citing Lykes v. United States , 1951, 343 U.S. 118 , 72 S.Ct. 585 , 96 L.Ed. 791 ; Helvering v. Winmill , 1938, 305 U.S. 79 , 59 S.Ct. 45 , 83 L.Ed. 52 ) and places reliance upon the Commissioner's regulations, 118 39.112 (g) -4.
In our view, this section casts little light on the problem.
On the other hand, 39.112(g) -1(c) of the regulations lends support to the Commissioner's position.
It provides in part: section 112(g) 112(c) section 112(g) We conclude that, if the "solely for voting stock" requirement of (B) and (C) reorganizations is to be given the effect intended by Congress, 112(c) cannot operate to render a stock-plus-boot acquisition a (B) or (C) reorganization through a disregard of the existence of boot.
In the case before us, then, the existence of boot prevents 112(g) (1) (B) from applying; since no reorganization exists, 112(b) (3) cannot apply; 112(c) is then also inapplicable.
Reversed and remanded with instructions that the deficiencies determined by the Commissioner be reexamined in the light of this opinion.
