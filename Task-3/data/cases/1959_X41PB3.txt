 WEICK , Circuit Judge.
Appellant was served with a subpoena duces tecum requiring him to produce certain records of the Civil Rights Congress before the Committee on Un-American Activities of the United States House of Representatives on February 27, 1952, at Detroit Michigan.
The subpoena called for: Appellant appeared before the Subcommittee, accompanied by one of his counsel of record here, and distributed to the Subcommittee members copies of a prepared statement and a petition.
He did not, however, produce the subpoenaed records.
Appellant was sworn as a witness and after giving his name and where he was born, admitted that he had been served with the subpoena.
After some sparring with Subcommittee counsel during which he invoked the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, he testified: Upon his refusal to produce the records, he was indicted for violation of Title 2 U.S.C.A. 192 .
1 He was tried by a jury, convicted and sentenced to nine months imprisonment and fined $500.
He appeals from the judgment of conviction.
In the District Court, appellant moved to dismiss the indictment and for a directed verdict of acquittal.
Both of these motions were carefully considered by the District Judge, in oral opinions, in which he analyzed the issues and discussed the authorities.
He denied the motions.
At the time of the trial in the District Court, the case of Watkins v. United States , 354 U.S. 178 , 77 S.Ct. 1173 , 1 L.Ed.2d 1273 (Decided June 17, 1957) had not been decided.
The Watkins case was heavily relied upon by appellant in his brief filed in this Court on January 13, 1958 in support of his contentions The latest pronouncement of the Supreme Court in Barenblatt v. United States , 360 U.S. 109 , 79 S.Ct. 1081, 1087 , 3 L.Ed.2d 1115 (Decided June 8, 1959) indicates that appellant's reliance on Watkins was misplaced.
See also Davis v. United States , 6 Cir., 1959, 269 F.2d 357 .
In considering whether the enabling resolution was unconstitutionally vague, the Court said: The Court further said: The holding in Barenblatt controls the contention that the resolution violated the First Amendment to the Constitution, id ., 360 U.S. at page 134 , 79 S.Ct. at page 1097 .
In regard to the issue of pertinency, appellant raised no objection on this ground before the Subcommittee.
This factor distinguishes the instant case from Watkins.
Mr. Justice Harlan, in Barenblatt, pointed out this distinction.
He said: Id 354 U.S. at pages 185, 209-215 77 S.Ct. at pages 1178, 1190-1194 360 U.S. at page 123 79 S.Ct. at page 1091 When the Subcommittee opened the hearings in Detroit, its Chairman made an announcement of the purpose and object thereof in which he said, among other things: The evidence disclosed that the Subcommittee had information to the effect that the Civil Rights Congress had been declared a subversive organization by the Attorney General of the United States and that appellant was executive secretary thereof.
A previous witness before the Subcommittee, Richard F. O'Hair, had testified that appellant was a member of the Midtown Club of the Communist Party.
Appellant had been fully advised by the Chairman of the Subcommittee as to the nature and purpose of the investigation, namely, as to Communist activity in the Detroit area and the nature, extent, character and objects thereof.
He was present with his counsel and had a prepared statement and a petition to file with the Subcommittee.
The Subcommittee, and not appellant, had the right to pass upon the pertinency of the subpoenaed records.
Cf. Barenblatt v. United States , supra , 360 U.S. at page 124 , 79 S.Ct. at page 1091 .
It could not do so because appellant had refused to produce them for its examination.
The pertinency claim is, therefore, without merit.
It is next contended that the trial judge erred in failing to direct a verdict of acquittal because the evidence failed to show that the subpoenaed records were in the possession or control of appellant.
The trouble with this contention is that, like the pertinency claim, it was never raised by appellant before the Subcommittee.
If he did not have possession or control of the records, proper respect for the authority of the Subcommittee would require him to so state.
The Subcommittee would then have had the opportunity to investigate and prove otherwise if such were the truth.
Appellant gave the Subcommittee no chance to consider the matter.
In flagrant disregard of the Subcommittee's authority, appellant's answer to the question whether or not he would produce the subpoenaed records was "I will not."
Having taken the position before the Subcommittee that he would not produce the records, he cannot now claim that the Government was required to show that they were in his possession or control.
If appellant had any legitimate excuse for not complying with the subpoena, he should have made it known to the Subcommittee on the return day.
Having failed to do so, he cannot urge it for the first time as a defense to the charge in the indictment.
Cf. United States v. Bryan , 339 U.S. 323 , 70 S.Ct. 724 , 94 L.Ed 884 ; United States v. Fleischman , 339 U.S. 349 , 70 S.Ct. 739 , 94 L.Ed. 906 ; Morrison v. People of State of California , 291 U.S. 82 , 54 S.Ct. 281 , 78 L.Ed. 664 .
Finally, it is contended that the subpoena was so broad and all inclusive as to constitute an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.
The District Judge answered this contention quite effectively when he said: In our judgment, this was a correct statement of the law.
The judgment of conviction is affirmed.
