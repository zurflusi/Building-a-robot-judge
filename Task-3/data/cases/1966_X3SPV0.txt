 SOBELOFF , Circuit Judge.
Appellant Hayden is serving a sentence of fourteen years in the Maryland Penitentiary, having been convicted and sentenced in the Criminal Court of Baltimore City in June, 1962, for robbery with a deadly weapon.
After a hearing in the District Court on his application for a writ of habeas corpus, relief was denied, and from this action an appeal was taken.
In this court the petitioner's basic contention is that certain evidence admitted at trial was the product of an unconstitutional search and seizure.
The state maintains that the search and the seizure were lawful, and urges further that, even if unlawful, petitioner has waived his right to raise the issue in the federal courts because of his failure to object at trial, failure to appeal from the conviction, and withdrawal of his appeal from the state court's denial of post-conviction relief.
I An armed robbery occurred at eight o'clock on the morning of March 17, 1962, on the premises of the Diamond Cab Company in Baltimore.
Two cab drivers saw a man running from the scene and heard shouts of "hold up, stop that man."
The cab drivers, proceeding independently, followed the suspected robber to 2111 Cocoa Lane.
One of the drivers actually saw him enter the house.
The police were immediately notified and in a few minutes arrived at that address.
They had been told that the offender was a Negro about 5′8″, 25 years old, and wore a light cap and dark jacket.
The police knocked at the door and Hayden's wife answered.
The officers told her that they had information that a holdup man was in the house.
There is some dispute as to whether or not Mrs. Hayden objected to the entry of the officers.
However this may be, several officers entered and went to all three floors, and when no man other than Hayden was found in the house, they arrested him.
They seized a sawed-off shotgun and a pistol which they found in the flush tank of the toilet, some ammunition, a sweater, and a dark gray cap, found under Hayden's mattress, shotgun shells lying in a bureau drawer, and a man's jacket and trousers with a belt, discovered in a washing machine in the basement.
The police, however, found no stolen money.
The seized items were admitted in evidence without objection by the defendant's retained counsel.
The clothing was used to fix the identity of Hayden as the man seen running from the scene of the crime and into 2111 Cocoa Lane.
Hayden failed to appeal his conviction, but upon his confinement in the Maryland Penitentiary he promptly petitioned the state court for relief under the Maryland Post-Conviction Procedure Act.
Relief was denied without the taking of testimony.
On appeal from this action the Maryland Court of Appeals remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing with respect to the challenged lawfulness of the search and seizure.
After testimony, the post-conviction judge again denied relief, holding "that the search of his home and seizure of the articles in question were proper."
Thereupon, Hayden applied for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals of Maryland.
Before his application was acted upon, however, he requested its withdrawal.
The request was granted.
1 He filed the instant habeas corpus petition three months later.
His right to appeal to the Court of Appeals of Maryland is now barred by time.
II A. We deal first with the failure of trial counsel to make a contemporaneous objection to the admission of the seized articles.
The state contends that the failure to object at trial constitutes a waiver by Hayden of his right to assert the constitutional claim in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.
In order to preclude consideration of the constitutional claim on federal habeas corpus the state must show that Hayden, acting through his attorney, voluntarily relinquished a known right by failing to object at trial 2 and that the failure to object constitutes an independent and adequate state ground.
See Henry v. State of Mississippi , 379 U.S. 443, 452 , 85 S.Ct. 564 , 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (1965), relying on Fay v. Noia , 372 U.S. 391, 438-439 , 83 S.Ct. 822 , 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963).
3 See also Dillon v. Peters , 341 F.2d 337, 339 (10th Cir. 1965).
It is unnecessary in this case to reach the question of whether Hayden voluntarily relinquished his constitutional claim, for in the state post-conviction proceedings the Court of Appeals of Maryland did not look upon the failure to object as a bar to his constitutional claim.
Instead it remanded the case to the lower court for a determination of the legality of the search and seizure.
Hayden v. Warden, Maryland Penitentiary , 233 Md. 613 , 195 A.2d 692 (1963).
Since the Court of Appeals of Maryland did not interpose the failure to object as a bar to consideration of the merits of the constitutional issue, denial of state post-conviction relief cannot be said to rest on an independent state ground.
The District Court was therefore not precluded from considering the constitutional question on its merits.
Cf. Henderson v. Heinze , 349 F.2d 67 (9th Cir. 1965); Nelson v. People of State of California , 346 F.2d 73 (9th Cir. 1965); Rhay v. Browder , 342 F.2d 345 (9th Cir. 1965).
When the highest court of a state has declined to invoke an independent state ground and has proceeded to the merits of a federal question, it would be incongruous for a federal court to assert the state ground to shut off its review of the federal question.
There appears to be no reason for a federal court to refuse to vindicate a federal claim by a more exacting insistence on state procedural requirements than the state court itself demanded.
The so-called independent ground, not having been relied on by the state, is simply irrelevant.
B. With respect to Hayden's failure to prosecute an appeal from his conviction and the withdrawal of his application for leave to appeal from the state post-conviction decision, the District Court determined that no such deliberate bypass occurred as would prevent Hayden from raising in the federal court the constitutional issue of illegal search and seizure.
We uphold the District Court's determination.
Hayden's letter to the clerk of the Court of Appeals of Maryland requesting withdrawal of his application for leave to appeal displays complete ignorance of both the judicial process and the consequences of not pursuing his judicial remedies in an orderly fashion.
4 Under these circumstances we cannot find error in the District Court's determination of no deliberate bypass.
See Fay v. Noia , 372 U.S. 391 , 83 S.Ct. 822 (1963); Pruitt v. Peyton , 338 F.2d 859, 860-861 (4th Cir. 1964); Hunt v. Warden, Maryland Penitentiary , 335 F.2d 936, 944 (4th Cir. 1964).
III Turning to the merits of Hayden's petition, we do not disagree with the District Court's determination that the arrest was lawful and the search conducted as an incident thereof constitutionally permissible.
A. Appellant does not strenuously contest the legality of his arrest.
He concedes that the officers had probable cause to believe that a felony had been committed and that the felon was hiding in the house.
There was testimony that the officers knocked on the door and announced the purpose of their entry.
The District Court so found the facts and concluded that regardless of the asserted lack of consent on the part of Mrs. Hayden to the entrance of the police, the officers were within their legal powers in entering in "hot pursuit" of a suspected felon.
5 Although the appellant concedes the right of the police to conduct a search as an incident to the lawful arrest, he maintains that in its extent the search exceeded constitutionally permissible limits.
The testimony showed that when the officers, approximately five in number, entered they knew only that a man suspected of robbery had run into the house.
Not finding the suspect on the first floor, one officer proceeded to the basement while others went to the second floor, where they found Hayden.
Learning that he was the only male in the house, the police arrested him, and conducted a search.
6 The arrest and search lasted one hour.
In its extent the search did not exceed the broad limits tolerated in Harris v. United States , 331 U.S. 145 , 67 S.Ct. 1098 , 91 L.Ed. 1399 (1947), where the Supreme Court affirmed the validity of an intensive five-hour search of all four rooms of an apartment, undertaken as an incident to a lawful arrest.
B. This brings us to the principal substantive issue presented by this appeal.
The petitioner contends that even if the search itself were legal, the articles of clothing seized by the police were "of evidential value only" and that under the principle repeatedly declared by the Supreme Court, items having evidential value only are not subject to seizure and must be excluded at trial.
Gouled v. United States , 255 U.S. 298, 310 , 41 S.Ct. 261 , 65 L.Ed. 647 (1921); United States v. Lefkowitz , 285 U.S. 452, 464-466 , 52 S.Ct. 420 , 76 L.Ed. 877 (1932).
See also Abel v. United States , 362 U.S. 217, 234-235 , 80 S.Ct. 683 , 4 L.Ed.2d 668 (1960); Harris v. United States , 331 U.S. 145, 154 , 67 S.Ct. 1098 (1947).
The petitioner maintains therefore that under Mapp v. Ohio , 367 U.S. 643 , 81 S.Ct. 1684 , 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), the admission of the articles of clothing at his state trial violated his constitutional rights.
It cannot be doubted that the proscription against seizure of articles of only evidential value is one of constitutional dimensions.
E. g., Gouled v. United States , 255 U.S. 298, 310 , 41 S.Ct. 261 (1921); United States v. Lefkowitz , 285 U.S. 452, 464-467 , 52 S.Ct. 420 (1932).
7 In Harris v. United States , 331 U.S. 145, 154 , 67 S.Ct. 1098, 1103 (1947), Chief Justice Vinson, relying on the above cited cases, and others, said: The dissenting opinions of Justices Frankfurter, pp.
155, 165-166, 67 S.Ct. pp.
1104, 1108 and Murphy, pp.
183, 187-188, 191, 67 S.Ct. pp.
1113, 1115, 1117 , specifically recognized the distinction made by the majority between items subject to seizure and items which may not lawfully be seized.
Thus, in the case dealing with the most extensive search ever validated by the Supreme Court, we find the Justices in the majority and those in dissent unanimous in condemning seizures by the police and the later use by the prosecution of articles having evidentiary value only.
The clothing in this case in no way constitutes the "means by which a crime is committed," unlike the things lawfully taken in Abel v. United States , 362 U.S. 217, 237-238 , 80 S.Ct. 683 (1960) (forged birth certificate and graph paper with coded message used to conduct espionage activities); Zap v. United States , 328 U.S. 624, 629 & n. 7, 66 S.Ct. 1277 , 90 L.Ed. 1477 (1946) (cancelled check used to defraud the Government); Marron v. United States , 275 U.S. 192, 198-199 , 48 S.Ct. 74 , 72 L.Ed. 231 (1927) (business ledger and various bills used to operate an illegal business); Gottone v. United States , 345 F.2d 165, 166 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 901 , 86 S.Ct. 234 , 15 L.Ed.2d 155 (1965) (lists of names and addresses with unexplained notations, race track results, and odds sheets used to operate illegal gambling business); United States v. Boyette , 299 F.2d 92, 94-95 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, sub nom.
Mooring v. United States , 369 U.S. 844 , 82 S.Ct. 875 , 7 L.Ed.2d 848 (1962) (guest checks used in the operation of a brothel).
There is no contention that the articles seized here were used by the felon as a disguise.
Nor did the possession of the clothing constitute a "continuing crime."
Examples of types of articles the possession of which constitutes a continuing crime can be found in United States v. Rabinowitz , 339 U.S. 56, 64 , 70 S.Ct. 430 , 94 L.Ed. 653 (1950) (forged and altered United States postage stamps), and Harris v. United States , 331 U.S. 145, 154-155 , 67 S.Ct. 1098 (1947) (false selective service cards).
No discussion is required to demonstrate that the clothing was neither contraband nor the fruit of the crime.
No Supreme Court case has discussed the seizure of clothing.
Cf. Kremen v. United States , 353 U.S. 346 , 77 S.Ct. 828 , 1 L.Ed.2d 876 (1957) (indiscriminate seizure of the entire contents of a cabin illegal).
Lower federal courts, however, have had occasion to consider the subject.
See Morrison v. United States , 104 U.S.App.D.C.
352 , 262 F.2d 449, 450-451 (1958) (handkerchief containing tangible evidence of morals offense of "evidential value only" and therefore held not subject to seizure); United States v. Lerner , 100 F.Supp.
765, 768 (N.D.Calif.1951) (identification bracelet, and documents, "merely evidentiary materials tending to connect the defendant with the crime for which he was arrested"--harboring or concealing a fugitive--and therefore held constitutionally not seizable); United States v. Richmond , 57 F.Supp.
903, 907 (S.D.W.Va.1944) (articles of wearing apparel useful in the identification of the defendant held not subject to seizure).
But cf. United States v. Guido , 251 F.2d 1, 3 (7th Cir.), cert denied, 356 U.S. 950 , 78 S.Ct. 915 , 2 L.Ed.2d 843 (1958) (shoes worn by bank robber held seizable as "the means" of committing the offense); Trotter v. Stephens , 241 F.Supp.
33, 40-41 (E.D.Ark.1965) (articles of clothing in the possession of accused rapists seizable, although court does not advert to rule prohibiting seizure of articles of only evidential value).
In the case before us the articles of clothing were introduced at trial either to aid witnesses in their identification of the defendant or to create an adverse inference by arguing consciousness of guilt from the unusual condition of the clothes in the washing machine and particularly the presence of the belt in the trousers.
However compellingly suspicious the circumstances, it cannot be denied that the value of the garment was "evidential only."
The Richmond case, above cited, 57 F.Supp.
903 , bears a remarkable resemblance to the one under consideration.
There, a federal agent observed a man working at an illicit still.
The following day the agent went to the defendant's home for the purpose of arresting him if it should turn out that he was the person seen at the still.
The agent made the arrest, and as an incident to this lawful arrest seized several articles of defendant's clothing which were later used in evidence for the purpose of demonstrating that other clothing found at the still matched that admittedly belonging to the defendant.
The court concluded that even while the search itself was reasonable, the clothing it produced was of evidential value only and hence constitutionally immune from seizure.
The state stresses the fact that before entering Hayden's house, the police officers had been given a brief description of what the suspect was wearing, and that the articles of clothing seized provided a strong link in the prosecution's case against Hayden.
But the potency of the evidence to convict was not accepted in Gouled as justification for its admission.
255 U.S. at 310 , 41 S.Ct. 261 .
In that case neither the officers' foreknowledge of the existence of the article seized, nor the prior issuance by a judicial officer of a search warrant describing the item served to validate the taking of "evidential" material.
255 U.S. at 307 , 41 S.Ct. 261 .
We recognize that the search conducted by the officers was lawful; but the law imposes limitations on the types of articles which agents of Government may seize either in the execution of a search warrant or in connection with a lawful arrest.
A succinct explanation of the underlying constitutional principle was provided by Judge Learned Hand: limitations upon the fruit to be gathered tend to limit the quest itself United States v. Poller 43 F.2d 911, 914 8 From time to time the line has wavered in the adjudication of the lawfulness of searches, but in no instance has the Supreme Court faltered in its adherence to the distinction so clearly enunciated by Judge Hand between what may and what may not be seized in a lawful search.
9 Nor do we perceive any rational distinction between private papers that are of only evidential value and articles of clothing of the same character.
The Fourth Amendment guarantees that "[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated."
(Emphasis added.)
Papers of only evidential value are not the sole items immune from seizure.
10 We are mindful that eminent judges and scholars have challenged the correctness and wisdom of the rule that precludes the seizure and admission in evidence of articles having evidential value only, even if the search which produced them was itself reasonable and lawful.
Chief Justice Traynor has sharply criticized the rule as "an unfortunate legal absurdity" and has argued further that it is not of such fundamental importance as to be applicable to the states through the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.
People v. Thayer , 63 Cal.2d 635 , 47 Cal.Rptr.
780 , 408 P.2d 108, 109 (1965).
11 Chief Justice Weintraub, while expressing doubt that the states have leeway to adopt a rule for search at variance with the federal rule fashioned by the Supreme Court, reasoned that shoes with distinctive heels worn by the defendant while committing an armed robbery were an instrumentality of the crime and could be searched for and seized under a warrant specifically describing them.
State v. Bisaccia , 45 N.J. 504 , 213 A.2d 185 (1965).
Directly confronting the mere evidence rule, Chief Justice Weintraub argues cogently that "things may be seized for their inculpatory value alone and that a search to that end is valid, so long as it is not otherwise unreasonable *."
213 A.2d at 193 .
Even so staunch an exponent of "individual liberties" as Professor Kamisar has criticized the rule as "unsound and undesirable."
Kamisar, "Public Safety v. Individual Liberties: Some 'Facts' and 'Theories,'" 53 J.Crim.L., C. & P.S. 171, 177 (1962).
See also Comment, "Eavesdropping Orders and the Fourth Amendment," 66 Colum.L.Rev.
355 , 370 (1966).
But cf.
Note, "Evidentiary Searches: The Rule and the Reason," 54 Geo.L.J.
593 (1966).
Judges, aware of the practical problems faced by police officers and prosecutors in the performance of their duties, have sometimes strained mightily to overcome the exclusionary effect of the mere evidence rule by stretching to the point of distortion the category of "instrumentalities of crime," in order to achieve the admission in evidence of articles manifestly of evidential value only.
For example, in United States v. Guido , 251 F.2d 1 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 356 U.S. 950 , 78 S.Ct. 915 (1958), it was broadly declared that shoes could be an instrumentality of crime, for a robber could hardly facilitate escape if he was "fleeing barefooted from the scene of the hold-up."
251 F.2d at 4 .
While the result in a particular case may not be unreasonable, it can hardly be squared with the pronouncements of the Supreme Court.
See Note, "Evidentiary Searches: The Rule and the Reason," 54 Geo.L.J.
593, 610 n. 106 (1966).
While we recognize that the rationale of the rule immunizing from seizure articles of only evidentiary value has been the subject of vigorous debate, we do not feel at liberty to abandon a doctrine so firmly established in the Supreme Court decisions.
12 It may be thought timely to expose the doctrine to re-examination and reinterpretation, with a view to formulating sufficiently flexible guidelines without endangering constitutional protections.
However, unless the Court sees fit to depart from its oft reiterated position, the judges of subordinate courts are obligated to adhere to it.
For the reasons outlined, the order of the District Court must be reversed and the case remanded with directions to grant the writ of habeas corpus and discharge the petitioner unless the state will retry him within a reasonable time.
Reversed and remanded.
