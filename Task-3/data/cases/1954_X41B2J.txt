 PARKER , Chief Judge.
These are appeals by the United States in three condemnation cases from awards of compensation for the taking of lands in connection with the Clark Hill water power and flood control development on the Savannah River.
The lands taken had been acquired in South Carolina and Georgia by the Twin City Power Company for the development of a power project at Price's Island in the Savannah River and condemnation cases for their taking were instituted by the United States in the court below and in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia.
Motions by the United States to strike portions of the answers which asserted the right of the owner of the lands to have their availability for the development of water power considered in connection with market value raised before the judge below the only question presented by this appeal; and his opinion in entering the order denying the motions deals with the question ably and conclusively.
See United States v. 1532.63 Acres of Land , 86 F.Supp.
467 .
Commissioners to value the lands were appointed by the court below acting in conjunction with the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia.
United States v. 3928.09 Acres of Land, 12 F.R.D. 127 .
The commissioners heard evidence on the question of compensation and filed a comprehensive report showing that the lands taken, when considered in connection with their availability for water power purposes, had a value of $267.02 per acre, and valued them accordingly.
The commissioners further found that for agricultural purposes or as wild forest land, without reference to availability for development of water power, the lands would have had a value of around $37 per acre.
The court below entered judgment for the landowner and its mortgagee in accordance with the valuation of the commissioners, United States v. 3928.09 Acres of Land , D.C., 114 F.Supp.
719 ; and the United States has appealed.
1 No question is raised on the appeal except with respect to considering the availability of the lands for water power purposes on the question of valuation, the contention of the United States being that "the value of land as a potential power site on a navigable stream is not an element of just compensation under the Fifth Amendment ".
We agree with the judge below that this contention cannot be sustained.
There is practically no dispute as to the facts.
They are thus stated by the District Judge in his order denying a petition for rehearing: Savannah River Electric Co. v. Federal Power Comm. 164 F.2d 408 It is provided by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States that private property shall not be taken for public use "without just compensation"; and in arriving at just compensation all elements entering into the value of the property taken must be given consideration.
The most profitable use of the land here being taken is use in the development of water power; and there is no basis in law or in reason why this element of value should be ignored.
The land was acquired by the owner for that purpose; and it is now being acquired by the United States for that purpose.
As was well said by the District Judge in his opinion, 114 F.Supp.
at page 723 : The rule applicable in such a situation is that stated in Olson v. United States , 292 U.S. 246, 255, 256 , 54 S.Ct. 704, 708, 709 , 78 L.Ed. 1236 , as follows: Mississippi & R. R.

T. V. A. v. Powelson , 319 U.S. 266, 275 , 63 S.Ct. 1047 , 87 L.Ed. 1390 .
When the case last cited was before this court on remand from the Supreme Court, we went carefully into the rule applicable in a case of this sort and laid down what we understand to be the proper rule in the following language, 138 F.2d 343 at pages 345-346 : And we do not think that, because the availability of the land for water power purposes arises from the fact that it is appurtenant to a navigable stream, such availability should be ignored in appraising value for purposes of condemnation.
What is being taken is, not the flow of the stream or the bed of the stream, but adjoining land which is being taken to form the basin of a reservoir; and, if its present availability for such use adds to its market value, there is no reason why this must not be taken into consideration in determining the compensation to be paid the owner, if just compensation is to be accorded him as required by the Constitution.
We recognize, of course, that under the power to regulate interstate commerce the government has a servitude with respect to the bed of a navigable stream and the flow of water therein and may remove any obstruction to navigation without being liable in damages therefor, United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co. , 312 U.S. 592 , 313 U.S. 543 , 61 S.Ct. 772 , 85 L.Ed. 1064 ; but that is not what the government is doing here.
It is taking, not the bed of the stream, but lands adjacent to the stream and is taking them, not for purposes of navigation, but for the primary purposes of flood control and the development of water power.
2 Cf. United States v. Gerlach Live Stock Co. , 339 U.S. 725, 739-742 , 70 S.Ct. 955 , 94 L.Ed. 1231 .
It is well settled that the "right of the United States in the navigable waters within the several states is limited to the control thereof for purposes of navigation", Port of Seattle v. Oregon & W. R. Co. , 255 U.S. 56, 63 , 41 S.Ct. 237, 239 , 65 L.Ed. 500 ; and that, as to fast land, "The absolute ownership and right of private property in such land is not varied by the fact that it borders on a navigable stream".
Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co. , 13 Wall. 166, 182 , 20 L.Ed. 557 .
Consequently, even where improvement of navigation is the purpose, any taking outside the bed of the stream of adjacent "fast" lands must be compensated for as in any other taking of private property.
United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co. , 229 U.S. 53, 60, 65 , 33 S.Ct. 667 , 57 L.Ed. 1063 .
This would seem to be elementary since the limitations of the Fifth Amendment apply to the government when exercising the commerce power as well as other powers.
Certainly, it is absurd to contend that, because the government is given control of navigation in the river and may exercise the servitude incident to such control, it may build a dam for water power purposes and take lands of private owners to form a basin for the reservoir thus created without paying the reasonable value of the land so taken.
As said by Mr. Justice Brewer in Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States , 148 U.S. 312, 337, 338 , 13 S.Ct. 622, 631 , 37 L.Ed. 463 : Very much in point is the case of United States v. Kansas City Life Insurance Co. , 339 U.S. 799 , 70 S.Ct. 885 , 94 L.Ed. 1277 , wherein the construction of a dam on the Mississippi River, purely in aid of navigation, caused the raising of the river continuously to high water level and, as the result of underflowing caused thereby, destroyed the value of adjacent lands for agricultural purposes.
The court held that the United States in the exercise of the power to regulate commerce could not take lands beyond the bed of the stream without liability therefor, and that the underflowing of the riparian lands involved constituted a taking for which compensation must be paid.
In distinguishing the case of United States v. Willow River Power Co. , 324 U.S. 499 , 65 S.Ct. 761 , 89 L.Ed. 101 , and other cases holding that there was no liability for exercise of power relating solely to the bed of the stream, the court, speaking through Justice Burton, said 339 U.S. at page 808 , 70 S.Ct. at page 890 : but to award compensation where his title is not so burdened The court appended the following note to the last sentence of the above quotation: United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co. supra 312 U.S. 592 61 S.Ct. 772 85 L.Ed. 1064 It is argued that the adjacent owner does not own the water power value of the current of the river.
This is true; but it is also true that the government does not own or have any servitude over the adjacent fast lands.
A power development can no more be constructed without the one than without the other; and just as the adjacent owner may not take the current of the stream for his own uses from the government representing the public, so the government may not take his lands from him without making just compensation, which, as we have seen, includes every element which would properly be considered in determining market value.
Value with respect to the water power of a river does not reside solely in the flow of the stream.
Such flow would not create water power without the damming of the stream and the creation of a reservoir; and the reservoir could not be created without the taking of adjacent lands as a basin for it.
It is because of the availability of adjacent lands for this purpose that they acquire value that they would not otherwise have; and such value may no more be ignored in fixing just compensation than may any other element entering into the determination of what a willing purchaser would have to pay a willing seller in order to acquire the lands.
There is nothing to the contrary in United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co. , 229 U.S. 53 , 33 S.Ct. 667 , 57 L.Ed. 1063 ; but that decision, we think, when properly interpreted supports our conclusion.
It was there held that the United States could not be required to pay compensation for requiring the removal from navigable waters of a dam which was an obstruction to navigation nor for resulting decrease in the value of a factory site on fast lands adjacent thereto; but it was held also that in valuing these fast lands account might be taken of their availability for lock and canal purposes.
In overruling the exception of the government to an award of damages based upon availability for such purposes the court said, 229 U.S. at pages 76-77 , 33 S.Ct. at page 677 : Mississippi & R. River Boom Co. v. Patterson 8 Otto 403 98 U.S. 403, 408 25 L.Ed. 206, 208 The case of United States v. Willow River Power Company , 324 U.S. 499 , 65 S.Ct. 761 , 89 L.Ed. 101 , which is relied on by the United States, involved, not the taking of shore land for power purposes, but the reduction in the generating capacity of a plant resulting from an authorized navigation improvement.
See United States v. Kansas City Life Ins. Co. , 339 U.S. 799, 805-808 , 70 S.Ct. 885 , 94 L.Ed. 1277 .
In Continental Land Co. v. United States , 9 Cir., 88 F.2d 104 and Washington Water Power Co. v. United States , 9 Cir., 135 F.2d 541 , it appeared that there was no reasonable probability of the utilization of the lands for water power by private capital in the reasonably near future.
Precisely the opposite is the case here, where the evidence shows that, but for the government's undertaking the construction at Clark Hill, the lands here would have been acquired by the Savannah River Electric Company for power purposes.
3 In so far as the two cases last cited may be construed as holding that, because a riparian owner of lands on a navigable stream has no property right in the bed or flow of the stream against the United States, he may not recover for the power site value of the lands, even though there is a present probability of their use for power purposes which has added to their market value, we think that this is contrary to what is clearly held by the Supreme Court in cases heretofore cited.
We are not impressed by the argument that availability for water power development may not be considered in awarding compensation because under the Federal Water Power Act, 16 U.S.C.A. 791a et seq., a development can be constructed in the river only under permit from the Federal Power Commission.
As the Supreme Court pointed out in the recent case of Federal Power Commission v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. , 347 U.S. 239 , 74 S.Ct. 487, 494 , private proprietary rights existing under state law have not been abolished by the Federal Water Power Act.
In that case the court said: In Ford & Son v. Little Falls Co. , 280 U.S. 369, 377, 378 , 50 S.Ct. 140, 141 , 74 L.Ed. 483 , it was held that the act did not preclude the recovery of damages for the impairment of a water power as the result of the backing of water by a down stream development which the Federal Power Commission had licensed under the act.
The court, speaking through Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Stone, said: United States v. Realty Co. 163 U.S. 427 16 S.Ct. 1120 41 L.Ed. 215 Guthrie National Bank v. City of Guthrie 173 U.S. 528, 535 19 S.Ct. 513 43 L.Ed. 796 Joslin Mfg. Co. v. City of Providence 262 U.S. 668, 675, 676 43 S.Ct. 684 67 L.Ed. 1167 Otis Co. v. Ludlow Mfg. Co. 201 U.S. 140, 152 26 S.Ct. 353 50 L.Ed. 696 Oswego & Syracuse R. R. Co. v. State 226 N.Y. 351, 356 124 N.E. 8 See also Grand River Dam v. Grand-Hydro , supra , 335 U.S. 359, 372 , 69 S.Ct. 114 .
Some confusion in thinking seems to have arisen because the building of the dam at Clark Hill was unquestionably within the power of the government and necessarily precludes the building of a dam at Price's Island.
The answer is that the lands of plaintiff have value for water power purposes because they furnish a portion of the basin of a reservoir needed for the development of water power, and that this is true whether the dam creating the reservoir be located at Price's Island or at Clark Hill.
There is nothing to show and no reason to think that their market value is any less because they can be used in connection with the development at Clark Hill than if they had been available for use only in connection with a development at Price's Island.
There can be no question but that, if the Savannah River Electric Company had been allowed to construct the Clark Hill project, it would have had to compensate Twin City for the Price's Island property on the basis of the manifest value of that property for water power purpose.
When the government takes over the project, there is no reason in law, in justice or in common honesty why it should not pay compensation on the same basis.
As said by Mr. Justice Brewer in the passage above quoted from the Monongahela Navigation case, reasoning which leads to any other result "must have some vice, at least the vice of injustice"; and injustice in determining compensation to be paid for property taken violates the requirement of the Fifth Amendment that the compensation be just.
Affirmed.
