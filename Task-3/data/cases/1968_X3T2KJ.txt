 HUTCHESON , Circuit Judge.
Appellant is incarcerated under sentence of death, having been convicted by a Texas jury of murder with malice.
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction, Jackson v. State , 403 S.W.2d 145 (1966), and later refused habeas corpus.
We affirm the denial of federal habeas corpus relief.
An initial challenge is to the trial court's receipt of testimony relative to an inculpatory statement made by appellant before he was given the warnings required by Miranda v. State of Arizona , 384 U.S. 436 , 86 S.Ct. 1602 , 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and Escobedo v. State of Illinois , 378 U.S. 478 , 84 S.Ct. 1758 , 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964).
This complaint was not presented to the Texas courts or to the court below; consequently, it is not available for our consideration.
1 Two other errors relate to the competence of prosecution witness Albert Bowie, the mentally retarded adult son of the victim.
Appellant introduced probate records which showed that Albert had been adjudged non compos mentis some years prior to the trial, and objected to receipt of the testimony on the ground that Albert was not a competent witness.
The state presented two rebuttal witnesses, one a sister of Albert.
Both asserted that Albert was, although retarded, honest and able to relate the truth.
In his qualification of the Bill of Exception to allowance of Albert's testimony, the trial judge revealed that he had observed Albert during the course of the trial and had engaged him in private conversation immediately prior to his taking the stand.
The decision on competence was based at least in part upon this association to which appellant was a stranger.
Appellant's contention that Albert was not competent is a contest to the discretion of the trial judge.

Review of such discretion presents no federal question.
Fernandez v. Klinger , 346 F.2d 210 (9th Cir. 1965); Buder v. Bell , 306 F.2d 71 (6th Cir. 1962).
It is also urged that the court's private examination of Albert Bowie constituted a denial of appellant's right to confront and cross-examine the witness and hence a denial of 14th Amendment due process.
2 Although the right of cross-examination is absolute, it is not unrestricted; the scope of such examination may be limited by the trial judge in the exercise of his discretion.
3 In particular, where the issue is admissibility of evidence, any testimony received is not "against" the defendant.
The voir dire examination of a witness is preparatory to receipt of his testimony-in-chief--an aid to the court's discretionary determination 4 --and cross examination need not be allowed.
5 Although the practice here complained of does not receive our unreserved approval, we hold that so long as some opportunity is had to cross-examine the witness' testimony-in-chief, as was had by appellant here, there is no constitutional irregularity.
In accordance with what was then the Texas procedure, the county sheriff was charged with shepherding the sequestered jury during appellant's trial.
He was also a witness for the prosecution.
6 Appellant contends that this situation denied him a fair and impartial jury under Turner v. State of Louisiana , 379 U.S. 466 , 85 S.Ct. 546 , 13 L.Ed.2d 424 (1965).
However, this court has read Turner as limited to situations in which the jury custodian's testimony was central to the development of the case for the prosecution and in which his contact with the jury was continual and intimate.
See Crawford v. Beto , 385 F.2d 156 (5th Cir. 1967); Bowles v. State of Texas , 366 F.2d 734 (5th Cir. 1966).
The record here demonstrates that neither was the sheriff a principal witness 7 nor did he have any contact with the jury other than in the courtroom.
8 The mere performance of this dual role as a prosecution witness and official jury custodian did not, in these circumstances, threaten prejudice to appellant or deny him a fair trial under Turner .
The denial of habeas corpus is Affirmed.
