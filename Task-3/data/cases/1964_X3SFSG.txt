 WOODBURY , Chief Judge.
On petition of Insurance Workers' International Union, AFL-CIO, the National Labor Relations Board in a proceeding under 9(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. 159(c) , certified the Union as the bargaining representative of all debit insurance agents, including all canvassing regular and office account agents, at Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's district office in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.
The Company deliberately refused to bargain collectively with the Union in order to challenge the appropriateness of the employee unit certified by the Board.
See American Federation of Labor v. NLRB , 308 U.S. 401, 411 , 60 S.Ct. 300 , 84 L.Ed. 347 (1940); Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. NLRB , 313 U.S. 146, 154 , 61 S.Ct. 908 , 85 L.Ed. 1251 (1941).
The Company agrees with the Board's classifications of employees included and excluded.
That is to say, the Company does not contend that the unit certified by the Board contains ineligible employees or employees whose interests are antagonistic.
Its contention is that an employee unit consisting of the debit insurance agents working out of only its one Woonsocket district office is inappropriate.
Its position is that the only appropriate unit would encompass either 1) all of its offices in the United States or 2) all of its offices in its New England Territory (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts and Rhode Island), or 3) all of its offices in Rhode Island.
Furthermore, it says that in determining that the debit insurance agents at only one of its eight district offices in Rhode Island constituted an appropriate unit for collective bargaining, the Board treated as controlling the extent to which the Union had so far organized its employees in Rhode Island in clear violation of 9(c) (5) added to the National Labor Relations Act by the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 144 (1947), 29 U.S.C. 159(c) (5), quoted in its pertinent context in the margin.
1 The Board's policy for determining appropriate bargaining units of debit insurance agents has not been consistent over the years.
In Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. , 56 NLRB 1635 (1944), the Board announced that, departing from its previous policy, it would in the future, in the absence of unusual circumstances, avoid setting up units of debit insurance agents smaller than state-wide in scope.
It said: Id. at 1639-1640 In 1961 a majority of the Board in Quaker City Life Ins. Co. , 134 NLRB 960 , changed the policy the Board had established in the Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. case in 1944 by determining that the debit insurance agents of Quaker City's one district office in Alexandria, Virginia, constituted an appropriate bargaining unit.
The majority in the Quaker City case quoted from the language quoted above from the Metropolitan Life case and said: solely Quaker City Life Ins. Co. 134 NLRB 960, 962 The two dissenting members of the Board said that they could see "no valid reason for departing from the Metropolitan Life rule which the Board adopted in 1944."
Id. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, Judge Boreman dissenting, enforced an order of the Board requiring Quaker City Life Insurance Company to bargain collectively with the same union involved herein as the bargaining representative of the unit certified by the Board in its underlying representation proceeding.
NLRB v. Quaker City Life Insurance Company , 319 F.2d 690 (C.A.4, 1963), enforcing 138 NLRB 61 (1962).
In subsequent cases a majority of the Board, with the same two members dissenting, certified as appropriate units consisting of nine of Metropolitan's district offices in the Cleveland, Ohio, metropolitan area (six offices in the City and three suburban offices eight or nine miles distant), Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. , 138 NLRB 512 (1962), [unfair labor practice decision, 141 NLRB No. 96 (1963)] on appeal to Sixth Circuit, Case No. 15366; two of Metropolitan's three district offices in Delaware, Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. , 138 NLRB 565 (1962), [unfair labor practice decision, 141 NLRB No. 37 (1963)] on appeal to Third Circuit, Case No. 14390, 328 F.2d 820 .
Metropolitan's single district office in Sioux City, Iowa, together with two detached offices under its administrative control in Fargo, North Dakota, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota, 284 and 120 miles distant, respectively, from Sioux City, Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. , 138 NLRB 734 (1962); and all of Metropolitan's district offices within the political limits of the City of Chicago, thereby excluding suburban offices even though six of the thirty-three city district offices had territories extending beyond the city limits and three of the fourteen suburban offices had territories extending into the city.
Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. , 144 NLRB No. 15 (1963).
In Equitable Life Ins. Co. , 138 NLRB 529 (1962), the Board determined appropriate a unit consisting of two district offices in Cleveland, Ohio, with a detached office in Lorain, Ohio, 28 miles away.
And in this case the Board majority relying on prior decisions determined that one district office out of eight in a small densely populated state constituted an appropriate bargaining unit.
The two dissenting members of the Board merely referred to their dissents in the Quaker City Life Ins. Co. case and in others in which they had not only reiterated that they saw no reason to depart from the policy established in the Metropolitan Life case of 1944, but had said that it appeared to them that the majority's unit determination was based upon the union's extent of organization of the debit agents involved.
We are very well aware that 9(b) of the Act confers such broad discretion on the Board that a unit determination by it "if not final, is rarely to be disturbed."
Packard Motor Car Co. v. NLRB , 330 U.S. 485, 491 , 67 S.Ct. 789, 793 , 91 L.Ed. 1040 (1947); International Typographical Union Local 38 v. NLRB , 278 F.2d 6, 10 (C.A.1, 1960), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 365 U.S. 705 , 81 S.Ct. 855 , 6 L.Ed.2d 36 (1961).
But we would be remiss in our duty as an enforcing court should we overlook or ignore an evasion by the Board of the command laid upon it by 9(c) (5) , supra .
We are seriously handicapped in this case by the Board's failure to articulate specific reasons for its unit determination.
It merely said in a footnote to its decision and direction of election: Metropolitan Life Insurance Company 138 NLRB No. 73 2 Metropolitan Life Insurance Company 136 NLRB No. 87 3 Not only do the cases cited by the Board majority not directly support its decision, but also the criterion of location in a separate and distinct geographical area is not a criterion consistently applied by the Board as its decisions in Metropolitan's Cleveland and Chicago cases cited herein above clearly demonstrate.
In the Chicago case the Board majority said: Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. 144 NLRB No. 15 At first blush there is a certain plausibility to this reasoning despite doubts that city boundaries provide a more satisfactory basis for determining a separate and distinct geographical area than do the business-prescribed areas delegated to each company office or the metropolitan area which has developed through natural growth.
4 Plausibility fades, however, upon consideration of Metropolitan's Cleveland case wherein the Board majority had previously decided that the Cleveland metropolitan area constituted an appropriate unit and certified a combination of six offices in the city and three in the suburbs, Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. , 138 NLRB 512 (1962).
Why there should be a community of interest among Metropolitan's agents working from both city and suburban offices in Cleveland but no community of interest among its agents working in both city and suburban offices in Chicago is not explained by the Board majority and is beyond our comprehension.
5 The Board majority in this case did not discuss what weight, if any, it gave to the factor of extent of union organization.
Nor indeed has the majority done so in any of its decisions since Quaker City. 6 Looking at its actions, however, we have not found a single instance since Quaker City wherein the majority of the Board refused the debit insurance agent unit petitioned for by the Union.
We would not consider this fact alone decisive for we would hesitate to assume that the Board was subservient to the Union.
Yet we believe this fact is entitled to considerable weight in the light of the testimony of the Union's vice-president in Metropolitan's Cleveland case, supra , which was incorporated by stipulation in the record in the instant case, that if the Union did not succeed in organizing on a broader basis it would as a matter of policy petition for a unit "on a district basis."
Indeed it is apparent that the Union followed this policy in the present case for in May and June 1962 it had engaged in organizational activities among agents attached to all of the Company's 8 district offices and 2 detached offices in Rhode Island, and it was only after lack of success in its state-wide attempt that it sought and received the Board's acceptance of the single district office in Woonsocket.
In short, the Union naturally wants units in which it can win elections and on the basis of the Board majority's actions, which speak more clearly than its words, it seems to us evident that in this case the Board majority in keeping with its apparent practice in recent years has given the Union the unit it wants.
In the absence of any statement by the Board majority of any other rational basis for its varying unit determinations, we can only conclude that the two member Board minority is correct in its charge that the majority has indeed reverted to its pre-1944 policy of regarding the extent of union organization as controlling in violation of 9(c) (5) of the Act.
A decree will be entered setting the Board's order aside and denying the Board's cross-petition for enforcement.
