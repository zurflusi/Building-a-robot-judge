 FOLEY, Jr.
, District Judge.
Appellant-Cross-Appellee will be referred to as the Commission and Appellees-Cross-Appellants jointly as Appellees and separately as MCA and Schreiber.
On February 26, 1959, by authority of 47 U.S.C. 403 , the Commission published in the Federal Register (FR 1605) its order that an investigatory proceeding be instituted " to determine the policies and practices pursued by the networks and others in the acquisition, ownership, production, distribution, selection, sale and licensing of programs for television exhibition, and the reasons and necessity in the public interest for said policies and practices *."
1 In the order, the hearing examiner designated to conduct the investigatory proceedings was authorized to receive evidence and make a record thereof, to administer oaths, subpoena witnesses, to compel their attendance, and compel the production of documentary evidence.
The order closed with this paragraph: The record reflects that while public sessions were being held in Los Angeles, California, the examiner issued a subpoena duces tecum to Schreiber, MCA's Vice President, commanding him to appear to testify and to produce documentary evidence described in the margin as Annex A and B. 2 At the time and place appointed, Schreiber appeared with counsel and produced the list in Annex A, but refused to submit the material subpoenaed in Annex B, although then and there in his possession, unless the Commission would accept said material on a confidential basis, contending that if the material was revealed at a public hearing, trade secrets would be disclosed.
Schreiber further refused to testify while the hearing was public and unless his counsel be given the right to object and to state grounds of objection on the record.
The examiner refused to close the hearing and to accept the subpoenaed material as confidential and directed that Schreiber's counsel not participate in the proceedings other than by being present and advising Schreiber.
Appellees petitioned the full Commission for review.
The examiner was affirmed on all points and Schreiber was ordered by the Commission to produce Annex B and to testify publicly regarding the same.
3 When Schreiber maintained the same position, the Commission sought enforcement in the court below pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 401(a) , 401(b), 409(f), and 409(g).
The learned trial Judge filed an opinion January 22, 1962, F. C. C. v. Schreiber , D.C., 201 F.Supp.
421 , and on March 2, 1962, filed his Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order.
The Conclusions of Law and Order are printed in the margin.
4 APPEAL BY COMMISSION We will first deal with the appeal by the Commission and will state the questions and errors specified in the language of the Commission set forth in its opening brief.
Questions Presented 1.
Whether the District Court erred in finding and concluding that any further interrogation of appellees and any documents produced by them shall be taken in a private, non-public proceeding and held by the Commission on a confidential basis; that the Commission must move the District Court for an order allowing the documents and testimony to be made public; and that appellees shall have the right to oppose such a motion.
2.
Whether the District Court erred in concluding that under Section 6(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 1005(a) , appellees have the following rights: Specification of Errors 1.
The District Court erred in its Finding of Fact XI.
2.
The District Court erred in its Conclusion of Law VII(b) and VII(c).
We will consider these questions and specifications of error in the order set forth above.
First Question and Specification of Error In his decision (pp.
425-426 of 201 F.Supp.
), the Trial Judge stated: Hunt Food & Industries, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission 286 F.2d 803, 813 The Trial Court's Finding of Fact No. XI reads: The Commission does not question that the Trial Court had the authority to impose safeguards to prevent the possible disclosure of trade secrets, while ordering that appellees appear, testify and disclose the material sought by the Commission, but contends that the District Court abused its discretion and therefore erred.
In Chapman v. Maren Elwood College , 9th Cir., 1955, 225 F.2d 230 , at Page 231, we stated: In Goldberg v. Truck Drivers Local Union No. 299 , 6th Cir., 1961, 293 F.2d 807 , at Page 814, the Court states: Hunt Foods & Industries, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission 286 F.2d 803, 811 365 U.S. 877 81 S.Ct. 1027 6 L.Ed.2d 190 In F. C. C. v. Cohn , S.D.N.Y.1957, 154 F.Supp.
899 , at Page 908, the Court held: Hale v. Henkel 201 U.S. 43 26 S.Ct. 370 50 L.Ed. 652 Chapman v. Maren Elwood College 225 F.2d 230 N. L. R. B. v. Anchor Rome Mills 197 F.2d 447, 449-450 and at Page 911 of 154 F.Supp.

American Rolbal Corp. 135 F.2d supra In Delno v. Market St. Ry. Co. , 9th Cir., 1942, 124 F.2d 965 , at Page 967, this Court said: In a recent case, Weller v. Dickson , 9th Cir., 1963, 314 F.2d 598 , beginning on Page 600, we said, in part: Hartford-Empire Co. v. Obear-Nester Co. 95 F.2d 414, 417 N. L. R. B. v. Gurnsey-Muskingum Elect.
Co-op. [Inc.] 285 F.2d 8, 11 In Wigmore on Evidence, McNaughton Revision, Volume VIII, Section 2212 , under the title "Trade Secrets and Customers' Names", we note the following language: We hold, therefore, that the Trial Judge did not abuse his discretion, but, on the contrary, established a fair and just procedure whereby a most important investigation could proceed without being unduly disrupted, obstructed or prolonged, and at the same time afford appellees protection against the improvident disclosure of possible valuable trade secrets.
Second Question and Specification of Error Did the District Court err in its Conclusion of Law No. VII(b) and (c), which reads, 6(a) The parties agree and we so hold that the proceedings in this case are investigatory and not adjudicative in nature.
They also agree that the right of counsel to object and argue objections on the record, if it exists in this case, is not a constitutional right, but a statutory right.
We concur; see Hannah v. Larche , 363 U.S. 420 , 80 S.Ct. 1502 , 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1960).
Does the first sentence of Section 6(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act ( 5 U.S.C. 1005(a) ) apply to fact-finding investigations by the Commission, or is the sentence applicable only to the Commission's adjudicative functions?
Professor Davis in his work, Administrative Law Treatise, Volume I, Section 8.10 , Right to Counsel, writes: " 6(a) Bowles v. Baer 142 F.2d 787 The first sentence of Section 6(a) has been held to assure the appearance of counsel with taxpayers and with other witnesses compelled to appear for examination before agents of the Internal Revenue Service conducting private investigations.
Backer v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue , 5th Cir., 1960, 275 F.2d 141 ; In Re Neil , D.C.S.D.W.Va., 1962, 209 F.Supp.
76 ; United States v. Smith et al.
, D.C.Conn., 1949, 87 F.Supp.
293 .
The statutory authority for the appearance of counsel in these cases is the Administrative Procedure Act.
In the Internal Revenue Code, Congress did not provide for the appearance of counsel in such cases.
The Trial Judge, in his opinion in this case, at Page 423 of 201 F.Supp.
, pointed out that in Hannah, the Supreme Court considered the meaning of the right to counsel before regulatory agencies conducting fact-finding investigations.
While this is true, in our reading of Hannah, the Civil Rights Act and not the Administrative Procedure Act is the source of authority for appearance of counsel.
The Supreme Court did not hold that the first sentence of Section 6(a) applies to investigations by regulatory agencies.
As a matter of fact, the Commission argues that in Hannah, the Court, by implication, took the contrary position.
Beginning at Page 445 of 363 U.S. , at Page 1516 of 80 S.Ct. , 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 , we find this language: 60 Stat. 237 5 USC 1001-1011 What the Supreme Court actually decided in Hannah was that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment did not require that, in fact-finding, nonadjudicative investigations, "the full panoply of judicial procedures be used due process embodies the differing rules of fair play, which through the years, have become associated with differing types of proceedings *" ( p. 442 of 363 U.S. , p. 1514 of 80 S.Ct. , 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 ).
Thus, in stating that when an agency acts quasi-judicially, it is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act and the parties are accorded the "traditional safeguards of a trial", the Court is indicating that the Administrative Procedure Act assures due process under the Fifth Amendment where there is a trial-type, adjudicative proceeding.
Unlike the Civil Rights Act considered in Hannah, the Federal Communications Act does not provide for the appearance of counsel when the Commission conducts a fact-finding, nonadjudicative investigation.
Therefore, unless the first sentence of Section 6(a) applies, counsel's right to appear and participate in the instant hearing exists only by virtue of the Commission's duly promulgated Rules and Regulations.
Since the Supreme Court has not decided the question of the applicability of the first sentence of Section 6(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act to nonadjudicative, fact-finding investigations, neither should we, unless it is necessary.
We need not and do not do so, because, assuming that the first sentence of Section 6(a) applies to the instant investigation, we hold that its requirements have been met.
5 Appellees contend that the word "represented" in the phrase "the right to be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel" in the first sentence of Section 6(a) entitled counsel to object and to state grounds in support of objections on the record and the Trial Judge apparently agreed.
This is a question of first impression.
We hold that the word "represented" must be read in light of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and therefore varies in meaning depending upon the nature of the function being exercised.
While counsel may, as a matter of right, object and argue objections on the record, just as he may, as a matter of right, cross-examine and call witnesses in a trial-type, adjudicatory proceeding, these rights do not exist in the fact-finding, nonadjudicative investigation unless specifically provided by statute or duly promulgated rules.
The right to object and argue objections on the record is not to be implied, here, from the use of the word "represented" in Section 6(a) .
The Commission's proposed Conclusion of Law No. VII reads as follows: "VII Hannah v. Larche 363 US 420, 446 80 S.Ct. 1502 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 6(a) 5 USC 1005(a) The Trial Court rejected the Commission's proposed Paragraph VII in favor of Paragraph VII proposed by appellees.
For the reasons given, the Trial Court erred in so doing.
Under the Federal Communications Act, the Commission has the authority to limit counsel in this regard.
Inherent in the Commission's power of investigation ( 47 U.S.C. 403 ) is the authority "to prevent the sterilization of investigations by burdening them with trial-like procedure."
( Hannah v. Larche , Page 448 of 363 U.S. , Page 1518 of 80 S.Ct. , 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 ).
The reasoning in Hannah supports our position.
There, the Court quotes with approval a rule of the Federal Trade Commission that while "persons summoned to appear before investigative proceedings may have the advice of counsel, 'counsel may not, as a matter of right, otherwise participate in the investigation.'"
( p. 446 of 363 U.S. , p. 1517 of 80 S.Ct. , 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 .).
Cross Appeal by Appellees Appellees contend that the District Court erred by failing to conclude that the Commission is without power to compel appellees to produce documents requested and to give testimony until the Commission complies with the requirements of Section 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act by promulgating and publishing proper rules governing the procedures for investigative proceedings.
The language of Section 3(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act relied upon by appellees is found in 5 U.S.C. 1002 , and in its pertinent parts, reads, Appellees contend, generally, that the Commission is required to promulgate and publish rules and regulations governing investigations similar to the Commission's rules of practice applicable to its adjudicative proceedings ( 47 C.F.R. 1.11-1.56 ) and specifically that there must be promulgated and published procedures governing the role of counsel, witnesses and review by the Commission of determinations made by the Examiner.
The Commission cites Section 1.10 of its Rules and Regulations ( 47 C.F.R. 1.10 ), as follows: Proceedings before the Commission The Commission calls to our attention that it has published in the Federal Register some thirteen orders governing this proceeding.
6 We find that the record supports the Commission's position that appellees have had full and complete notice of all proceedings taken which concern them and that appellees have not been prejudiced in any manner by the Commission's failure to promulgate and publish rules and regulations if required.
Appellees apparently concede that this is so, but argue that they may be prejudiced in the future since the Commission's investigation has not been completed.
The Trial Judge found these objections without merit.
At Page 425 of 201 F.Supp.
, he said: 5 U.S.C.A. 1002 Hannah v. Larche supra 363 U.S. pp.
452-453 80 S.Ct. 1502 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 We also note Paragraph X of the Conclusions of Law reads: "X Section 10(e) 5 U.S.C. 1009(e) It is not necessary for us to decide whether Section 3(a) applies to nonadjudicative, fact-finding investigations, and it is unnecessary to define the term "substantive rule" as used in Section 3(a) or to determine if the rules appellees seek constitute rules of substance or procedure, 7 since failure to promulgate and publish rules has not prejudiced appellees.
While Section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act directs the reviewing court to set aside agency action found to be taken without observance of procedure required by law, it also directs that the Court take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.
See Madokoro v. Del Guercio , 9th Cir., 1947, 160 F.2d 164, 167 , cert. denied 332 U.S. 764 , 68 S.Ct. 68 , 92 L.Ed. 349 ; Alesi v. Cornell , 9th Cir., 1957, 250 F.2d 877, 879 ; Florida Citrus Commission v. United States , D.C.N.D.Fla., 1956, 144 F.Supp.
517, 521 , aff'd.
352 U.S. 1021 , 77 S.Ct. 589 , 1 L.Ed.2d 595 .
We refuse to speculate about the future.
In the event other conflicts arise during the investigation, judicial review is available.
We find the cross appeal without merit.
We affirm the Trial Court, except that Subparagraphs (b) and (c) of Paragraph VII of the Conclusions of Law are stricken and the order below is modified to conform to this opinion.
