 PER CURIAM.
After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal.
See Fed.R.App.P.
34(a) ; 10th Cir.R.
34.1.9.
The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.
This appeal is taken from an order of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, 713 F.Supp.
1407 (1989), setting terms and conditions of defendant's release pending trial, notwithstanding the court's finding that no conditions or combination of conditions would reasonably assure his presence in court or the safety of the community, 18 U.S.C. 3142(e) .
1 The court directed release after determining that release on conditions was the appropriate remedy for violations of the failure to hold a detention hearing within the time requirements of 18 U.S.C. 3142(f) .
2 We affirm.
We recite the facts from the district court's memorandum opinion and order filed March 1, 1989.
Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 18 U.S.C. 3142(f) 18 U.S.C. 3142(f) 18 U.S.C. 3142(f) The district court temporarily stayed its release order to enable the United States to file a notice of appeal; thereafter, we stayed defendant's release pending further order of the court.
The government argues that the February 21 hearing on the detention motion was timely, that defendant's waiver of an immediate detention hearing (in Illinois) was a request for an indefinite continuance of the hearing for good cause, and that even if a violation of 3142(f) occurred, the remedy is a prompt detention hearing, not release.
Defendant contends that the time constraints of 3142(f) were violated and that the remedy chosen by the district court was correct.
First, we must determine the appropriate standard by which to review the district court's factual findings and legal conclusions.
Next we must consider whether the time requirements of 3142(f) were violated under the facts of this case. Finally, if violations of 3142(f) occurred, we must review the correctness of the district court's choice of remedy.
Under the Bail Reform Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C. 3141 , et seq.
, pretrial detention is presumptively appropriate for certain offenders upon a finding that "no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community."
3142(e) .
Further, certain offenses carry a presumption that no such conditions or combination thereof will assure appearance and safety, including violations of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 801 , et seq.
, where there is probable cause to believe that the person committed an offense for which the maximum term of imprisonment is more than ten years.
Id .
Under 3142(a) , upon the charged person's appearance before a judicial officer, the officer shall issue an order releasing the person on recognizance or on conditions, temporarily detaining the person under 3142(d) , or detaining the person under 3142(e) .
This case involves only 3142(e) .
Detention under 3142(e) requires a hearing under 3142(f) on motion of the government (f)(1), or on motion of either the government or the judicial officer (f)(2), depending on certain factors, the hearing is to be held "immediately upon the person's first appearance before the judicial officer," unless a continuance is sought.
Except for good cause, the government may have three days and the accused five.
An accused may be detained pending completion of the hearing, at which time the person is afforded counsel and may testify by himself or by witnesses.
The ultimate finding for purposes of 3142(e) "shall be supported by clear and convincing evidence."
A detention order issued pursuant to (e) is required to include "written findings of fact and a written statement of the reasons for the detention."
3142(i) .
In upholding the constitutionality of the Act, the Supreme Court noted that under 3142(f) , the arrestee is entitled to a prompt hearing.
United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739, 747 , 107 S.Ct. 2095, 2101 , 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987).
Nothing in 3142(e) provides for a "waiver" of the time requirements for the hearing, United States v. Hurtado , 779 F.2d 1467, 1474 n. 7 (11th Cir.1985); United States v. Al-Azzawy , 768 F.2d 1141, 1145 (9th Cir.1985), although a short postponement from the initial appearance in the arresting district (here Illinois) to the first appearance in the charging district (here New Mexico) has been upheld.
See United States v. Melendez-Carrion , 790 F.2d 984, 990 (2d Cir.1986) (removal hearing may precede detention hearing, leaving latter to occur in prosecuting district after removal).
See also United States v. Dominguez , 783 F.2d 702, 704-05 (7th Cir.1986).
Among the issues necessary to resolving the question of whether the detention hearing was timely are (1) when, under these facts, defendant had his first appearance, (2) whether an immediate detention hearing is waivable (and, if so, for how long), and (3) whether defendant in fact waived his right to an immediate hearing.
We are confronted by the same difficulties as the district court because the facts are far from crystal clear.
At the outset, we join these circuits which have held that appellate review of detention or release orders is plenary, at least as to mixed questions of law and fact, and independent, with due deference accorded to the trial court's purely factual findings.
See United States v. Hurtado , 779 F.2d at 1471-72 , collecting and analyzing cases from the First, Third, Sixth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits: United States v. Bayko 774 F.2d 516, 519-20 (1st Cir.1985); United States v. Delker , 757 F.2d 1390, 1399-1400 (3d Cir.1985); United States v. Hazime , 762 F.2d 34, 36-37 (6th Cir.1985); United States v. Maull , 773 F.2d 1479, 1487 (8th Cir.1985); United States v. Motamedi , 767 F.2d 1403, 1406 (9th Cir.1985).
See also United States v. Portes , 786 F.2d 758, 762 (7th Cir.1985) (joining majority of circuits adopting independent review standard).
At the hearing before the magistrate in Illinois, the government did not specifically move for pretrial detention because counsel for both sides and the defendant had agreed that the preliminary and detention hearings should take place in New Mexico.
The government's intention to move for pretrial detention, however, is clear enough, and defendant was thus provided with ample notice of the government's proposed course of action.
Additionally, 3142(f)(1) does not expressly require the government to make a written motion for pretrial detention.
United States v. Volksen , 766 F.2d 190, 192 (5th Cir.1985).
On this record, we believe the government adequately moved for pretrial detention at the Illinois hearing.
However, by the time of the first hearing before the magistrate in New Mexico on February 16, six days had elapsed since defendant's arrival there.
The government had not yet filed a formal motion for pretrial detention, nor had a motion for continuance been sought.
Even if we assume that on February 10 defendant could be deemed to have waived his right to an immediate detention hearing (a question we need not answer), and even if we construe counsel's agreement to postpone the detention hearing as an implicit request for a continuance under 3142(f)(2) , the permissible time period had expired by February 16.
See, e.g. , United States v. Malekzadeh , 789 F.2d 850, 851 (11th Cir.1986) (defendant can implicitly agree to continuance of detention hearing); United States v. Valenzuela-Verdigo , 815 F.2d 1011, 1015-16 (5th Cir.1987) (inferring from record that five-day continuance from initial appearance to hearing was "in substance" requested by defendant).
Most troubling, however, is the magistrate's decision, sua sponte , to further continue the matter to February 21.
The statute does not authorize a continuance by the judicial officer.
See United States v. Alatishe , 768 F.2d 364, 369 (D.C.Cir.1985) (judicial officer should not sua sponte delay detention hearing except in most compelling situations); United States v. Hurtado , 779 F.2d at 1475 (judicial officer lacks authority to sua sponte extend time for hearing).
The magistrate couched his continuance of the hearing in the following language: as the United States wishes to request Vol. II, p. 5.
However, neither the government nor the defendant requested a continuance.
Further, it is fair to conclude from reading the transcript of the February 16 hearing that the magistrate did not intend to conduct the detention hearing until the pretrial services report had been prepared.
(Vol. II, pp.
5-6.)
There is no indication why this report was not prepared between February 13 when the magistrate's office was first contacted regarding defendant and February 16 when the initial hearing was held in the charging district.
There was no finding of good cause for the continuance under 3142(f) , nor would the lack of a pretrial services report, without more, necessarily constitute good cause.
We conclude, then, as did the district court, that although the delay between the defendant's appearance in Illinois on February 10 and his first appearance in New Mexico on February 16 might be viewed as a minor violation of the maximum permissible period for a defense requested continuance, the further continuance of the hearing by the magistrate, sua sponte , constituted a material violation of the specific instructions Congress provided in crafting 3142(f) .
What Congress did not provide, however, is the remedy.
Consequently, circuit courts are divided in their conclusions as to what the remedy should be (which again is compounded by the variety of factual situations in which the question arises).
Compare United States v. Al-Azzawy , 768 F.2d at 1145 (if time constraints violated in material way, district court should not order unconditional pretrial detention); United States v. Payden , 759 F.2d 202, 205 (2d Cir.1985) (remedy for failure to provide hearing at first appearance was reconsideration under prior bail law); United States v. O'Shaughnessy , 764 F.2d 1035, 1038-39 (5th Cir.1985) (noncompliance with first appearance requirement for hearing precludes detention) appeal dismissed on rehearing as moot 772 F.2d 112 (5th Cir.1985); with United States v. Clark , 865 F.2d 1433, 1436 (4th Cir.1989) (en banc) (automatic release not appropriate remedy where requirements of Bail Reform Act not properly met); United States v. Coonan , 826 F.2d 1180, 1185 (2d Cir.1987) (where defendant otherwise incarcerated and defense counsel's position is that immediate hearing is unnecessary, government is not precluded from seeking detention even if hearing is more than five statutory days after initial appearance); United States v. King , 818 F.2d 112, 114-15 (1st Cir.1987) (where defendant already serving state sentence, detention hearing not required until release from state custody imminent); United States v. Vargas , 804 F.2d 157, 162 (1st Cir.1986) (assuming detention hearing inadequate and untimely, subsequent de novo hearing by district court cured defect); United States v. Hurtado , 779 F.2d at 1481-82 (where hearing untimely and inadequate, detention order would be reversed and matter remanded for de novo hearing at which merits of pretrial detention to be reconsidered).
See also United States v. Madruga , 810 F.2d 1010, 1014 (11th Cir.1987) (where defendant fails to object to hearing date, he can be deemed to acquiesce in up to five-day continuance); United States v. Holloway , 781 F.2d 124, 128-29 (8th Cir.1986) (where government's request for detention made at second appearance before same judicial officer, district court's original order setting bond would be reinstated); United States v. Fortna , 769 F.2d 243, 249 (5th Cir.1985) (no error in magistrate's scheduling of hearing five days after initial appearance where defendant needed to obtain counsel, no objection to continuance raised, and continuance not suggested by government).
Whether we construe defendant's February 10 agreement to move the hearing to New Mexico as a request for a five-day continuance or a waiver of the right to an immediate hearing, the second continuance, from February 16 to February 21, cannot be justified.
Nor do we agree with the premise that the waiver of an immediate hearing "can be viewed as a request for an indefinite continuance for good cause."
United States v. Clark , 865 F.2d at 1437 .
If the mandatory restrictions on the length of time a hearing can be continued, delayed, or postponed are to have any import, we believe the consequences for violations, at least where material and not the fault of the defendant, must likewise be substantive.
Under the circumstances of this case, the subsequent holding of a de novo hearing by the district court did not cure the fact that the New Mexico magistrate was without authority to extend the date of the hearing from February 16 to February 21 absent a finding of good cause.
Thus, the district court was correct in selecting the only meaningful remedy available--release on conditions.
Accordingly, the memorandum opinion and order filed March 1, 1989, is AFFIRMED.
