 EDWARDS , Circuit Judge.
In this case certain students at Kent State University, including officers of the Student Association, and other student organizations, seek broad injunctive relief against the Governor of Ohio and the commanding officers of the Ohio National Guard, and a declaratory judgment, declaring unconstitutional a certain immunity statute, Ohio Rev.Code 2923.55 (Supp.1969).
The complaint was brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983 (1970), with jurisdiction asserted under 28 U.S.C. 1343(3) (1970).
The District Judge dismissed the complaint on motion without either answer or affidavits being filed by appellees, and without hearing.
His brief order stated that the pleading failed to state a claim cognizable under federal law.
The disposition employed by the District Judge is, of course, the least favored judgment which the appellate courts review.
Here the issues (assuming for the moment some triable issues were stated) have never become joined.
Appellees have never even filed either answer or motion for summary judgment supported by affidavits.
When a case comes to us in such a posture, we are compelled to assume the truth of all of the plaintiffs' allegations of fact, plus the reasonable inferences which flow from those facts.
This court has recently restated these principles: See Jenkins v. McKeithen 395 U.S. 411, 423-424 89 S.Ct. 1843 23 L.Ed.2d 404 Glus v. Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal 359 U.S. 231 79 S.Ct. 760 3 L.Ed.2d 770 Taylor v. Kentucky State Bar Association 424 F.2d 478, 480 Honey v. Goodman 432 F.2d 333, 336 This fundamental statement of the same principles is found in a unanimous United States Supreme Court decision: 5 "5.
See, e. g. , Leimer v. State Mutual Life Assur.
Co. , [8 Cir.] 108 F.2d 302 ; Dioguardi v. Durning , [2 Cir.] 139 F.2d 774 ; Continental Collieries v. Shober , [3 Cir.] 130 F.2d 631 ."
Conley v. Gibson , 355 U.S. 41, 45-6 , 78 S.Ct. 99, 102 , 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).
No one is under our system of law turned away from the courthouse door without a proper adjudication if he has filed a sworn complaint which is cognizable in our law.
With these principles in mind, we turn to analyze the instant complaint.
We believe that fairly read it seeks to state three related causes of action: 1) In the first instance the complaint is an attack upon the "premature" calling out of the Ohio National Guard by Governor Rhodes on May 1, 1970, and its dispatch to the campus of Kent State University "to displace civilian authority."
The relief sought is an injunction against such "premature" employment of the Guard on future occasions.
2) The complaint also constitutes an attack upon the conduct of the Guard troops upon their arrival at Kent State.
Here the allegations are that the defendants, who controlled the troops, without necessity for doing so violated the students' rights of speech and assembly, made unconstitutional arrests, beat and injured students "needlessly" and employed live rifle fire against an unarmed crowd and killed and injured a number of students without appropriate legal justification.
In this phase of the complaint the allegations also are that these claimed violations resulted from policies and practices of defendants which constitute a continuing pattern of conduct which threatens plaintiffs with future such violations.
3) The complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment finding unconstitutional an Ohio Statute, Ohio Rev.Code 2923.55 (Supp.1969), which under certain detailed circumstances purports to grant immunity to National Guard troops (and other law enforcement personnel) from criminal charges arising out of their activities in suppressing riots.
Each of these causes of action (although dismissed as a whole) deserves separate consideration.
I The Attack Upon the Executive Emergency Power In this aspect of this appeal appellants ask the courts to engage in prior restraint upon the exercise of emergency power specifically committed by constitution to the executive branch of government.
In this phase of the pleading we find no facts which call for hearing, no relief sought which the court below could appropriately have granted, and no allegations of a breach of actionable rights.
As to this aspect of the case, we affirm the District Court.
At the outset, this complaint concedes that there was disorder which had not been terminated by normal civilian controls and that such disorders were continuing as of the time the Governor called out the troops.
The complaint says: Executive decisions to call out military force have been litigated a number of times in the history of the Republic.

Peabody , 212 U.S. 78 , 29 S.Ct. 235 , 53 L.Ed. 410 (1909); Ex parte Milligan , 4 Wall. 2 , 71 U.S. 2 , 18 L.Ed. 281 (1866); Luther v. Borden , 7 How. 1 , 48 U.S. 1 , 12 L.Ed. 581 (1849); Martin v. Mott , 12 Wheat.
19 , 25 U.S. 19 , 6 L.Ed. 537 (1827).
But we find no instance where the courts have sought to substitute judicial judgment for the constitutionally empowered judgment of the executive.
Still less have the courts cumbered that executive judgment with the prior restraint of an injunction seeking to describe in advance the precise conditions which would make its exercise appropriate.
Indeed, in the case principally relied upon by appellants, the Supreme Court of the United States said: Martin v. Mott 12 Wheat.

Constantin 287 U.S. 378, 399 53 S.Ct. 190, 195-196 77 L.Ed. 375 Recently the Fourth Circuit provided some of the practical logic for our decision on this point: United States v. Chalk 441 F.2d 1277, 1281 II The Alleged Continuing Threats to Constitutional Rights As to the second cause of action sought to be pled, we quote in full the relevant language from the complaint: 1 The question which we think these paragraphs serve to pose, when the complaint is read with the fair inferences which may be deduced from it, is this: Was there and is there a pattern of training, weaponry and orders in the Ohio National Guard which singly or together require or make inevitable the use of fatal force in suppressing civilian disorders when the total circumstances at the critical time are such that nonlethal force would suffice to restore order and the use of lethal force is not reasonably necessary?
A citizen complaint that state action threatens federally protected rights is, of course, cognizable in the federal courts under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: In Sterling v. Constantin , 287 U.S. 378 , 53 S.Ct. 190 , 77 L.Ed. 375 (1932), the same case we have previously relied upon in affirming dismissal of the first phase of this case, the Supreme Court affirmed a federal District Court's injunctive relief against the Governor of Texas and other state officials who under claim of military necessity had taken over control of privately owned oil fields.

Even more obvious recognition of federal judicial power to vindicate federal Constitutional rights claimed to be abused by state power is found in recent cases in United States Courts of Appeals.
Lankford v. Gelston , 364 F.2d 197 (4th Cir. 1966); Build of Buffalo, Inc. v. Sedita , 441 F.2d 284 (2d Cir. 1971).
In a recent decision the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky has conducted a full hearing on somewhat similar complaints pertaining to state actions concerning disorders on the campus of the University of Kentucky.
The complaint therein was dismissed after a hearing on the facts and this court has affirmed that decision.
Bright v. Nunn , 448 F.2d 245 (6th Cir. 1971).
The partial dissent in this case relies basically on a form of abstention usually referred to as the political question doctrine.
At the height of its influence in the federal courts, it caused the courts to abstain from adjudicating many asserted federal constitutional violations in fields as widely diverse as voting rights and the rights of prisoners in correctional institutions.
The diminished vitality of the political question doctrine is specifically illustrated in such voting rights cases as Reynolds v. Sims , 377 U.S. 533 , 84 S.Ct. 1362 , 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964), and Baker v. Carr , 369 U.S. 186 , 82 S.Ct. 691 , 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962), and in such prisoner rights cases as Haines v. Kerner , 404 U.S. 519 , 92 S.Ct. 594 , 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) and Inmates of Attica Correctional Facility v. Rockefeller , 453 F.2d 12 (2d Cir. 1971).
It is worth emphasizing that the Haines case came down on January 13, 1972, from a unanimous Supreme Court.
There is a hint in the dissent that perhaps the Constitution conveys to the Executive and to Congress such powers over the military forces as to exclude any form of judicial review.
No express language of the Constitution may be found which even arguably supports such a proposition when it is applied to the use of military force in domestic affairs.
Cases we have cited previously ( Duncan v. Kahanamoku , supra ; Sterling v. Constantin , supra ; Ex parte Milligan , supra ) stand in flat contradiction to this proposition.
See also Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , 343 U.S. 579 , 72 S.Ct. 863 , 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952).
Obviously, if the control of ultimate force were in the hands of the Executive alone, constitutional government in our democracy would rest entirely upon the will (and whim) of one man.
The final point made by the dissent is that there is no conceivable form of relief which the District Court could have rendered.
Far more applications for injunctive relief are filed, heard and denied on the merits in the federal courts than are ever granted, and such, of course, may well prove to be the case when the issues here sought to be presented are actually the subject of proofs.
Nonetheless, the right to be heard is itself a constitutional right of vital importance.
Further, if the District Court after evidentiary hearing were to find from the facts developed before it that an affirmative answer should be made to the summary question previously phrased in this opinion, we have no doubt that the District Court will find much material available for devising a suitable remedy.
See , for example: Prevention and Control of Mobs and Riots, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Dept.
of Justice, J. Edgar Hoover (1967) (See Appendix to this opinion.
); 32 C.F.R. 501 (1971), "Employment of Troops in Aid of Civil Authorities"; Instructions for Members of the Force at Mass Demonstrations, Police Department, City of New York (no date); Report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (1968).
As to further speculation on the form of relief, we follow the Supreme Court admonition in Baker v. Carr , supra : Baker v. Carr supra 369 U.S. at 198 82 S.Ct. at 699 As to this phase of this complaint, the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
III The Attack on the Constitutionality of Ohio Rev.Code 2923.55 The third cause of action upon which plaintiffs sought adjudication was, we believe, properly dismissed below.
The relief sought concerning the statute was a declaratory judgment and no injunctive relief as to this issue was prayed for.
The statute attacked has never been construed by the appellate courts of Ohio.
Viewing the statute on its face, we perceive no substantial federal constitutional issue.
The statute reads: 2923.55 Death or injury of rioter by use of necessary force section 2923.51 Ohio Rev.Code 2923.55 What this language purports to do is to grant immunity to policemen, firemen and members of the armed forces from prosecution for killing, maiming or injuring a rioter during a riot "as a consequence of the use of such force as is necessary and proper to suppress the riot or disperse or apprehend rioters."
On its face before the immunity came into existence, this statute would seem to call for proofs that a riot existed, that there had been an order to desist and disperse which had been defied, and that force had been required to suppress the riot.
The statute might be argued to grant immunity from prosecution as a result of the use of lethal force against "rioters" where the circumstances above were present; but this immunity would only come into being where the use of such lethal force was "necessary and proper."
The necessary and proper language appears to us (as apparently it did to the District Judge) to be an approximation of the reasonable cause standard of the common law applicable to the use of fatal force.
Schweder v. Baratko , 103 Ohio App. 399 , 143 N.E.2d 486 (1957); Skinner v. Brooks , 74 Ohio App. 288 , 58 N.E.2d 697 (1944); 6 C.J.S.
Arrest 13a at 612 (1937).
If it be contended that contrary to the construction above this statute has been construed by the Ohio National Guard as authorizing the use of fatal force, even if under the circumstances lesser force would serve to restore order, such proofs would be admissible under the second issue as to which we are remanding this case, and appropriate relief could be granted thereunder.
It remains, of course, to be determined in the District Court under Rule 23 and 23.2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure whether or not plaintiffs are appropriate representatives of the class they purport to represent and whether or not, as appellees contend, the United States is a necessary party to this suit.
Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
