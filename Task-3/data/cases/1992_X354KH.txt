 PER CURIAM.
In 1990, Charles Liteky, Patrick Liteky, and Father Roy Bourgeois spilled blood on federal property as part of a protest against the United States' involvement in El Salvador.
The defendants were convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. 1361 , which prohibits "willfully injur[ing] any property of the United States " Before the trial, the defendants requested that the district judge recuse himself, see 28 U.S.C. 144 ; 28 U.S.C. 455(a) , because he had presided over Father Bourgeois' 1983 conviction, which also related to a protest regarding United States policy toward El Salvador.
But matters arising out of the course of judicial proceedings are not a proper basis for recusal.
United States v. Alabama , 828 F.2d 1532, 1540 (11th Cir.1987), cert. denied , 487 U.S. 1210 , 108 S.Ct. 2857 , 101 L.Ed.2d 894 (1988); In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litigation , 614 F.2d 958 (5th Cir.), cert. denied , 449 U.S. 888 , 101 S.Ct. 244 , 66 L.Ed.2d 114 (1980); Davis v. Board of School Comrs.
, 517 F.2d 1044 (5th Cir.1975), cert. denied , 425 U.S. 944 , 96 S.Ct. 1685 , 48 L.Ed.2d 188 (1976).
Therefore, the district court properly rejected the motion.
The defendants also contend that the district court denied them a fair trial.
After carefully reviewing the defendants' arguments as well as the record on appeal, we have concluded that those arguments are without merit.
Conclusion We AFFIRM the convictions.
