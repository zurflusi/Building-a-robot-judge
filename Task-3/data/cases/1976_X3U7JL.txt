 PER CURIAM: On this petition to review by the networks (American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., CBS, Inc., and National Broadcasting Company, Inc.), and an application by the National Labor Relations Board to enforce an order of the Board, 217 N.L.R.B.
No. 159 (1975), requiring the union (Writers Guild of America, West, Inc.) to cease and desist from certain conduct during a strike found to be in violation of Section 8(b)(1) (B) of the National Labor Relations Act and to take certain affirmative action to remedy the violations, we find the essential issue to be whether as a matter of law the Board correctly applied Section 8(b)(1) (B) in concluding that the union restrained and coerced the employers by threatening to blacklist and discipline and by fining and expelling from membership certain supervisory personnel who crossed the picket lines during a strike.
For substantially the reasons set forth in the dissenting opinion of Board Member John H. Fanning, 217 N.L.R.B.
No. 159 , we hold that the Board as a matter of law incorrectly applied Section 8(b)(1) (B) to the instant case and we deny enforcement of the Board's order.
See Florida Power & Light Co. v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 641 , 417 U.S. 790 (1974).
Enforcement denied.
