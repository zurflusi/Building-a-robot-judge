 PER CURIAM: Juatassa Sims appeals the district court's affirmance of the Commissioner's denial of her application for disability insurance benefits, contending that the administrative law judge: (1) failed to afford proper weight to a psychologist's opinion that she was severely depressed; (2) improperly excluded certain of her impairments in assessing her residual function capacity; and (3) should have ordered a consultative examination to assess her mental impairments.
We affirm.
We lack jurisdiction to review Sims's second and third contentions because they were not raised before the Appeals Council.
1 The first contention is without merit because the ALJ is entitled and expected to determine the credibility of medical experts and to weigh their opinions accordingly.
2 Concluding that the findings of the ALJ are supported by substantial evidence, the judgment appealed is AFFIRMED.
