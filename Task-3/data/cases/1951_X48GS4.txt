 MATHEWS , Circuit Judge.
Appellants 1 were indicted for violating 3 of the Smith Act, 2 were allowed bail by District Judge Mathes in the sum of $50,000 each and, in default of furnishing such bail, were detained in the custody of appellee, United States Marshal James J. Boyle.
Alleging that the bail required of them was excessive, appellants petitioned the District Court for writs of habeas corpus.
Orders to show cause were issued, returns were filed, a hearing was had before District Judge Harrison, an order was entered denying the petitions, and appellants have appealed from the order.
We affirm the order for the following reasons: First.
Habeas corpus is not a proper remedy for one charged, as appellants were and are, with an offense against the United States and detained, as appellants were and are, in the custody of a United States marshal in default of furnishing bail alleged to be excessive.
3 The proper remedy in such a case is a motion for reduction of bail.
4 Therefore, regardless of whether the bail required of appellants was excessive, their petitions for writs of habeas corpus were properly denied.
Second.
Judge Harrison did not find that the bail required of appellants was excessive.
Instead, he found that the bail required was "necessary to assure the presence of [appellants] in the further proceedings in the criminal case." 5 We cannot say that the finding was clearly erroneous.
Therefore we should affirm the order, even if we considered habeas corpus a proper remedy for one charged with an offense against the United States and detained in the custody of a United States marshal in default of furnishing bail alleged to be excessive, which we do not.
Order affirmed.
