 BARNES , Circuit Judge.
I. The Private Plaintiff in Anti-Trust Litigation .
Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides: 15 U.S.C.A. 15 Passing for the present an examination of what "thing" is forbidden, we note a tendency in some courts to narrow the apparent scope of this statute due to concern with the severity of the penalty.
1 In a recent case this Court said: Flintkote Co. v. Lysfjord 246 F.2d 368, 398 355 U.S. 835 78 S.Ct. 54 2 L.Ed.2d 46 Of more importance is what the Supreme Court has said.
In reversing an antitrust case from this Circuit in 1957, that Court admonished the trial and appellate federal courts that: 2 With these principles in mind, we proceed to an examination of what is forbidden by the antitrust laws, as stated in Section 4 of the Clayton Act.
The Sherman Act's first and second sections are relied on by the pleadings in this case. 3 Does the Sherman Act mean every contract, and every restraint, or must it be interpreted?
Must it be aided by a Rule of Reason, and if so, what is that Rule of Reason?
The problem is not a new one, nor is it easy.
Not only do competent judges disagree--they frequently reach similar destinations by differing circuitous routes.
4 Suffice it to say that from a period shortly after the early pronouncements of our Supreme Court which made the Sherman Act a comparatively dead law, 5 succeeding Supreme Court Justices have found it necessary to interpret the precise language used in the Act and determine its proper construction.
6 Even such a "literalist" as Mr. Justice Peckham eventually came to that view, 7 at least with regard to what constituted interstate commerce, even if he could not agree with Mr. Justice White 8 on what was meant by "every restraint."
And, although the statutory language "is literally all encompassing, the courts have construed it as precluding only those contracts or combinations which 'unreasonably' restrain competition."
8a With this brief introduction, let us turn to the pleadings and evidence of this case. II.
The Pleadings .
Plaintiff corporation sues many defendants, claiming a cause of action under Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, 9 by reason of defendants' alleged violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.
10 The complaint alleges plaintiff is the owner and operator of a retail store engaged in the business in San Francisco of selling radios, television sets, clothes washers, refrigerators, electric and gas stoves, phonographs and various electrical appliances.
Plaintiff charges defendant Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., a corporation, is a competitor in the purchase and sale of such household appliances, operating a chain of stores in the western states and one specific store in the general vicinity of plaintiff's retail store in the Mission District area of San Francisco, California.
The eighteen other defendants named are ten leading manufacturers 11 and eight distributors 12 of such household appliances mentioned above.
Plaintiff charges that all defendants beginning prior to 1952 "have restrained trade and commerce in the interstate distribution and sale" of the described types of goods in the San Francisco area "by contracting, combining, conspiring together, and each with the other in restraint and monopoly of such trade and commerce" and "have substantially lessened, limited, and restrained competition in said trade and commerce."
13 Various alleged discriminations in sale, supply, price terms, etc., are charged in count one of the complaint as part of the conspiracy.
Counts two through thirty-one charge violations of the Robinson-Patman Act 14 and counts thirty-two through forty-one charge violations of 13(f) of the Robinson-Patman Act 15 --discrimination in price, services, etc. III.
Proceedings in the District Court .
By pre-trial order count one was limited to a single conspiracy charging a Sherman Act violation.
16 Subsequently, under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 42(b) , 28 U.S.C.A., the trial court ruled: All but one of the defendants (18 of 19) then moved to dismiss count one of the complaint, In support of this motion, the moving parties submitted a dozen affidavits.
Appellant stood on the pleadings and papers on file, filing no documents in opposition to the motion.
It should be noted here that the court below did not rule on the pleadings nor grant the motion to dismiss by reason of any failure therein.
While a motion to dismiss was made, it was apparently passed over so that the motion for summary judgment could be determined.
That latter motion having been granted, it was necessarily dispositive of the motion to dismiss.
The District Court granted the motion for summary judgment by preliminary order and subsequent formal judgment. 17 The preliminary order is short, and reads as follows: This appeal is from the motion granting summary judgment.
Count one alone is involved.
The other forty counts are not before us.
IV.
The Issues .
Appellant makes but one specification of error--namely, that it was error to grant a motion for judgment or dismiss a complaint seeking damages under 4 of the Clayton Act based upon an alleged violation of the Sherman Act plus consequent damage to plaintiff because the complaint had failed to allege and plaintiff had failed to prove, as an additional element, a "public injury."
Appellees do not agree that the trial court's action (and alleged error) can be so described.
They agree that if there has been alleged a violation of the Sherman Act, plus consequent damage to a private plaintiff, a cause of action is stated.
They claim a violation of the Sherman Act was not pleaded, and more important, not established by the evidence before the court on the motion to dismiss.
This was because the restraint of trade relied on was not a restraint of trade recognized as such at common law which constitutes a per se violation of the Sherman Act; and in the absence of such a type of violation, there must be alleged a restraint, injurious to the public if proved, in order to constitute an actionable violation of the Sherman Act, either in pleading or proof.
The question before the trial court, say appellees, and now here, is this: and secondarily, Both questions must be answered affirmatively, say appellees, before appellant can prevail.
To put it another way, appellant contends that any contract, combination or conspiracy which restrains trade or commerce, no matter in what degree and no matter against whom or how many persons similarly situated the restraint is directed, always violates the Sherman Act proscription.
Appellant argues that all necessarily 18 Appellees, on the other hand, contend with equal vigor that not every restraint upon a single competitor is a restraint of trade or commerce within the meaning of the Sherman Act.
They argue, in essence, that a plaintiff, in order to succeed on this motion for summary judgment must allege in his complaint (if he is willing to rely solely upon it in opposition to appellees' affidavits) sufficient facts to prove, or from which it may be inferred, that the public as a whole is or may be in some way affected by the defendants' conduct; i.e., that the conduct attacked has some substantial effect on the particular relevant market involved.
Appellant quotes at length from, and largely relies upon, both the briefs filed and the opinion rendered in Radovich v. National Football League, 19 certain motion picture antitrust cases, e.g. such as United States v. Paramount Pictures , 1948, 334 U.S. 131 , 68 S.Ct. 915 , 92 L.Ed. 1260 ; United States v. Schine Chain Theatres , 1948, 334 U.S. 110 , 68 S.Ct. 947 , 92 L.Ed. 1245 ; United States v. Griffith , 1948, 334 U.S. 100 , 68 S.Ct. 941 , 92 L.Ed. 1236 ; Bigelow v. R.K.O.
Radio Pictures , 1946, 327 U.S. 251 , 66 S.Ct. 574 , 90 L.Ed. 652 ; Binderup v. Path√© Exchange , 1923, 263 U.S. 291 , 44 S.Ct. 96 , 68 L.Ed. 308 ; Hart v. B. F. Keith Vaudeville Exchange , 1923, 262 U.S. 271 , 43 S.Ct. 540 , 67 L.Ed. 977 , and pleadings cases like United States v. Employing Plasterers Ass'n , 1954, 347 U.S. 186 , 74 S.Ct. 452 , 98 L.Ed. 618 .
It is appellant's position that "Radovich overruled this court and thus overruled its principal supports, Fedderson 20 and Shotkin."
21 Appellees urge that they have carefully maneuvered around the pitfall of a motion to dismiss premised on the pleadings; that they have filed twelve affidavits uncontradicted by anything other than the complaint, as amended by pre-trial order; 22 that the court passed on an "undisputed factual situattion;" 23 and, that the trial court's finding and the summary judgment based thereon is required by 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, particularly in Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader , 1940, 310 U.S. 469 , 60 S.Ct. 982 , 84 L.Ed. 1311 , and those cases which are claimed to follow it.
V. The Facts .
The facts, as set forth in the affidavits, and undisputed by appellant, were summarized by appellees as follows: in San Francisco 24 Mission District alone to Mission street alone VI.
The Law .
Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader , supra , teaches that not every restriction on commerce is a restraint of trade within the meaning of the Sherman Act.
First, the restraint must "occur in or affect commerce between the states for constitutional reasons."
Id ., 310 U.S. at page 498 , 60 S.Ct. at page 995 .
We need not concern ourselves here with the substantiality of the amount of commerce involved.
Apex tells us "it is the nature of the restraint and its effect on interstate commerce and not the amount of the commerce which are the tests of violation."
Id ., 310 U.S. at page 485 , 60 S.Ct. at page 987 .
25 Second, "the restraints at which the Sherman law is aimed, and which are described by its terms are only those which are comparable to restraints deemed illegal at common law *."
[Emphasis added.]
Id ., 310 U.S. at page 498 , 60 S.Ct. at page 995 .
The drafters of the Sherman Act "extended the condemnation of the statute to restraints effected by any combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, as well as by contract or agreement, having those effects on the competitive system and on purchasers and consumers of goods or services which were characteristic of restraints deemed illegal at common law *."
Ibid. In deciding the question of whether a conspiracy of workers to stop factory production was "the kind of restraint of trade or commerce at which the Act is aimed, " 26 the Supreme Court in Apex had the same question (in different form) to answer as is here raised by the motion to dismiss.
It is to be remembered that in Apex this question was required to be answered "even though a natural and probable consequence of their (the strikers') acts and the only effect on trade or commerce was to prevent substantial shipments interstate by the employer."
27 the precise question which we are called upon to decide is whether that restraint is the kind of 'restraint of trade or commerce' which the Act condemns 28 The court then traces some of the background of the Sherman Act and states: 29 Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States 286 U.S. 427, 434 52 S.Ct. 607, 609 76 L.Ed. 1204 30 In Apex Justice Stone went on: United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. 85 F. 271 46 L.R.A.
122 175 U.S. 211 20 S.Ct. 96 44 L.Ed. 136 Appalachian Coals v. United States supra 228 U.S. 344 53 S.Ct. 471 77 L.Ed. 825 31 Radovich v. National Football League , 9 Cir., 1956, 231 F.2d 621, 623 , was a pleading case. In it, this Court decided on two grounds that plaintiff's complaint did not state a cause of action.
The first ground was that football was more like baseball ( Toolson v. New York Yankees , 1953, 346 U.S. 356 , 74 S.Ct. 78 , 98 L.Ed. 64 ; Federal Base Ball Club of Baltimore v. National League , 1922, 259 U.S. 200 , 42 S.Ct. 465 , 66 L.Ed. 898 ) than like boxing ( United States v. International Boxing Club , 1955, 348 U.S. 236 , 75 S.Ct. 259 , 99 L.Ed. 290 ).
Secondly, if wrong on the first premise, then Radovich's complaint did not "allege facts from which it can be determined as a matter of law that by reason of intent, tendency, or the inherent nature of the contemplated acts, the conspiracy was reasonably calculated to prejudice the public interest by unduly restricting the free flow of interstate commerce," quoting from Fedderson Motors v. Ward , 10 Cir., 1950, 180 F.2d 519, 522 .
Radovich alleged that there was a conspiracy to eliminate football leagues not affiliated with the defendant, hence, defendants were creating a monopoly.
The method alleged was to control the players by the "reserve clause" and "blacklists."
The alleged intent of the defendants in Radovich was to "boycott and ruin [defendant's competitor] the All America Conference."
This Court concluded that the means alleged were not calculated to prejudice the public or unreasonably restrain interstate commerce.
This Court failed "to discover any basis to say that the appellant has pleaded that All America or any other league was ruined, would be ruined or substantially affected by the complained of acts," and therefore felt there were no facts pleaded leading to the conclusion that the public had been adversely affected.
The Supreme Court ( 352 U.S. 445 , 77 S.Ct. 390 , 1 L.Ed.2d 456 ) considered both grounds relied on by this Court to affirm the District Court and found them untenable.
We are not concerned here with the Supreme Court's refusal to approve this Court's conclusion as to the similarity between football and baseball.
But appellant herein strongly relies upon the pronouncement of the Supreme Court with respect to the second point: public injury.
After disposing of the essential allegations of the substantial effect upon interstate commerce, the Supreme Court said: Hart v. B. F. Keith Vaudeville Exchange 262 U.S. 271, 274 43 S.Ct. 540, 541 67 L.Ed. 977 Id 262 U.S. at page 274 43 S.Ct. at page 541 32 The Court then cites United States v. Employing-Plasterers Association , supra , which again is a pleading case. The Supreme Court then states: Times-Picayune Pub. Co. v. U. S. 345 U.S. 594, 614 73 S.Ct. 872, 883 97 L.Ed. 1277 10 33 The Supreme Court, by Note 10 and reference to its earlier decision in Apex, defines what it means by "prohibited activities are injurious to the public" and what the "forbidden practices" are from which the public is to be protected.
Note 10 reads as follows: Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader 310 U.S. 469 60 S.Ct. 982 84 L.Ed. 1311 all of which had come to be regarded as a special form of public injury Id 310 U.S. at page 493 60 S.Ct. at page 992 34 To further emphasize the restriction to free competition to which it referred, the Supreme Court continued its Note 10 as follows: Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States 226 U.S. 20 33 S.Ct. 9 57 L.Ed. 107 The law is its own measure of right and wrong the judgment of the courts cannot be set up against it Id 226 U.S. at page 49 33 S.Ct. at page 15 35 We take it that by this Note the Supreme Court admonishes the inferior courts not to come to their own philosophical conclusions as to what restraints of trade should be prohibited, contrary to the language of a statute which was constituted and adopted with recognition of the existing rules of common law.
We cannot say what we may think it should be because of personal antitrust philosophy or predilection.
Times-Picayune Pub. Co. v. United States , 1953, 345 U.S. 594 , 73 S.Ct. 872 , 97 L.Ed. 1277 , is cited in Radovich , 352 U.S. at page 453 , 77 S.Ct. at page 395 , as setting up the tests by which any wholly non-frivolous claim of a plaintiff is to be tested.
In Times-Picayune the District Court had denied the government's motion for summary judgment which had urged that "the unit contracts" therein under attack were per se violations of 1 of the Sherman Act.
But after trial the District Court found that the defendants had instituted the unit contract system "in order to 'restrain general and classified advertisers from making an untrammeled choice'" between two competing papers "'in purchasing advertising space, and also to substantially diminish the competitive vigor of'" the opposing paper, and that this unit system was "economically enforceable against (advertising) buyers, solely because of the Times-Picayune's 'dominant' or 'monopoly position.'"
36 The Supreme Court, reviewing these findings, then related how the District Court had held 1 of the Sherman Act violated; that "tying arrangements" depended upon the market setting; and, that in the market setting found by the Supreme Court, "we do not think that the Times-Picayune occupied a 'dominant' position in the newspaper advertising market in New Orleans."
37 It was therefore necessary for the Supreme Court to test the advertising contracts under attack 1 United States v. Columbia Steel Co. 334 U.S. 495, 522 68 S.Ct. 1107, 1121 92 L.Ed. 1533 United States v. Griffith 334 U.S. 100, 105, 108 68 S.Ct. 941, 944, 946 92 L.Ed. 1236 United States v. Patten 226 U.S. 525, 543 33 S.Ct. 141, 145 57 L.Ed. 333 International Salt Co. v. United States 332 U.S. 392 68 S.Ct. 12 92 L.Ed. 20 1 1 334 U.S. at page 527 68 S.Ct. at page 1124 Standard Oil Co. of California and Standard Stations v. United States 337 U.S. 293, 312-313 69 S.Ct. 1051, 1061-1062 93 L.Ed. 1371 38 Mr. Justice Clark then treats the factual situation disclosed by the evidence, finds the advertising contracts were the results of endeavors to "rationalize" operations; were legitimate business aims; were not conceived to achieve monopolistic ends; were at least partially induced by competitive business considerations and "[did] not bespeak a purposive quest for monopoly or restraint of trade."
39 This case, to us, holds that "restraints of trade," as that language is used in the Sherman Act means "unreasonable" restraints of trade, and "unreasonable restraints of trade" are (1) illegal per se restraints interfering with free competition in business and commercial transactions which tend to (a) restrict production; (b) affect prices; or, (c) otherwise control the market to the detriment of the purchasers or consumers of goods and services, or (2) those restraints of trade, ordinarily reasonable, but made unreasonable because accompanied with a specific intent to accomplish the equivalent of a forbidden restraint.
Applying these tests to the instant facts we must ask: (1) What is the restraint relied upon?
(2) Is the restraint illegal per se ?
(3) If not, ( i. e. , if an otherwise reasonable restraint) is it accompanied with a specific intent to accomplish a forbidden restraint?
(4) Was the object of the contract or combination under attack an unreasonable restraint?
(5) Was the effect of the contract under dispute an unreasonable restraint?
Times-Picayune further suggests, that in determining what constitutes an " unreasonable restraint " (either sought by or resulting from defendants' acts), we must determine (a) the percentage of business controlled; (b) the strength of the remaining competition; (c) whether the action criticized was the result of business requirements or done with a purpose to monopolize.
Here the restraint relied on, as we see from the complaint, 40 was in preventing plaintiff from obtaining certain electrical appliances for resale, while at the same time permitting Broadway-Hale to purchase those certain electrical appliances.
This is a simple refusal to sell, allegedly by joint action.
Various other competing electrical appliances were shown by the record before the trial court to be available to Klor's, Inc. 41 Many other retailers sold these "certain electrical appliances" to the public, fifty-three in the Mission District of San Francisco alone.
The number of retailers in San Francisco from the start of the alleged conspiracy to the time of filing suit increased.
There was no charge or proof that by any act of defendants the price, quantity, or quality offered the public was affected, nor that there was any intent or purpose to effect a change in, or an influence on, prices, quantity, or quality, either directly or indirectly.
It is not suggested that either the object or effect of the alleged conspiracy was to create an unreasonable restraint, illegal per se.
If a business transaction and the effect and object of such transaction between two or more persons is lawful, then the transaction cannot be nor can it create an unlawful conspiracy.
If "X Company," a manufacturer, refuses to sell to Klor's, Inc., and sells to "Y Company", a retailer who also agrees to buy from "X" as long as "X" does not sell to Klor's, more than one person is involved, and they have agreed not to sell, but their act is not necessarily 41a illegal.
To a minute degree, any refusal to sell is a restraint of trade, in the ordinary sense; but it is not necessarily a restraint in the Sherman Act sense.
Some restraints of trade are reasonable, and hence not violative.
Others are not in, nor do they affect, interstate commerce, and hence are not violative.
Others are so remote in their effect on the public at large as not to be restraints for Sherman Act purposes.
Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader , supra ; Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers Association v. United States , 1914, 234 U.S. 600 , 34 S.Ct. 951 , 58 L.Ed. 1490 ; Miller Motors v. Ford Motor Co. , 4 Cir., 1958, 252 F.2d 441 , affirming 149 F.Supp.
790 ; Hudson Sales Corp. v. Waldrip , 5 Cir., 1954, 211 F.2d 268 ; Fedderson Motors v. Ward, supra , note 20; Westmoreland Asbestos Co. v. Johns-Manville Corp. , 2 Cir., 1943, 136 F.2d 844 .
The purpose of the antitrust statutes is to protect the "public" from the harm which follows from concerted or monopolistic conduct designed to acquire control of a market, usually competitive, to which the public must ultimately resort and which conduct can be described as an undue restraint of trade 42 Notwithstanding the many phrases which may be picked at random out of numerous cases and, out of context, be made to support the position that concerted conduct directed at harming the opportunity of a single trader to compete is always within the prohibitions of the Sherman Act, it is our opinion that there exists the need to show facts in a motion such as this from which a court might reasonably infer "public injury" before an antitrust violation is before the court; and, further, that the Supreme Court has not departed one whit from this requirement.
Where the particular conduct in restraint of trade is of the kind prohibited by the Act and where the inference of public injury reasonably can be extracted from the complaint, a good cause of action is stated.
Assuming these conditions are met, a private plaintiff has the right to bring an action for treble damages for injury to his business or property "by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws (Title 15, U.S.C.A. 15 ) and for an injunction."
(Title 15, U.S.C.A. 26 .)
However, the private right is not a remedy for a private wrong created by federal law.
The private right is a method of enforcing public rights and thereby providing additional means of enforcing the prohibitions of the statute.
"Congress has provided sanctions allowing private enforcement of the antitrust laws by an aggrieved party."
Radovich v. National Football League , supra , 352 U.S. at page 454 , 77 S.Ct. at page 395 .
In this way it is entirely accurate to assert that "these laws protect the victims of the forbidden practices as well as the public."
( Ibid. ) But the private right is a purely incidental means of enforcing the Act.
Before there can be any "forbidden practices" there must be an improper restraint of trade or commerce; once this is established or reasonably put in issue, the private right and the consequent private protection arise.
Without the prohibited restraint, there is no private right for there has been no violation, i. e. , there has been no conduct of defendants, which is or conceivably could be injurious to the public welfare.
Plaintiff must allege (and here prove) that there has been a prohibited restraint and that he has been proximately damaged thereby in order to sustain his complaint or position against a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment.
He need not allege, additionally, that the public has been injured by defendants' conduct.
But to have the prohibited restraint there must be facts from which it can be determined that the "conduct charged was reasonably calculated to prejudice the public interest by unduly restricting the free flow of interstate commerce."
Kinnear-Weed Corp. v. Humble Oil & Refining Co. , 5 Cir., 1954, 214 F.2d 891, 894 .
The Supreme Court in Radovich, relied on so heavily by plaintiff, said no more than this in quoting Justice Holmes' conclusion in Hart v. B. F. Keith Vaudeville Exchange , 1923, 262 U.S. 271, 274 , 43 S.Ct. 540, 541 , 67 L.Ed. 977 : Turning now to the cases cited to us by plaintiff, we are unable to discern any deviation from what we have just stated.
Plaintiff asserts that the case of Shotkin v. General Electric Co. , 10 Cir., 1948, 171 F.2d 236, 238 , established a new requirement for private antitrust litigation: that plaintiff is required to allege injury to the public in order to state a cause of action.
We are unable to find any such requirement in Shotkin.
In affirming the granting of a motion to dismiss, Judge Bratton, speaking for the Court, said: 43 We are unable to discern any new doctrine in the above extract.
It seems to be no more than a concise and accurate statement of well-established requirements for private recovery under the antitrust provisions.
It is true that on a motion for dismissal the complaint is to be broadly interpreted in a manner most favorable to the pleader; 44 but that does not mean that the court must find allegations of ultimate facts in conclusionary pleading, or a violation of the Sherman Act from allegations of action directed solely at plaintiff and which, as such, could have as a matter of law no conceivable effect on the competitive market.
Similarly with Fedderson Motors v. Ward , supra , which plaintiff argues continued the "new requirement" of public injury supposedly injected by Shotkin.
Fedderson also is a case where, on affirming a judgment dismissing the complaint, the court was unable to find any allegation of material fact evidencing an antitrust violation.
The Supreme Court in Radovich v. National Football League , supra , termed controlling of this case by plaintiff, did not, in our opinion, in any way overrule these cases.
The Court in Radovich did no more than to re-assert Justice Holmes' admonition that the test of sufficiency of the complaint is whether "the claim is wholly frivolous."
Id ., 352 U.S. at page 453 , 77 S.Ct. at page 395 .
In reversing this Court the Supreme Court determined that the allegation of defendants' attempt to eliminate from competition the All-America Conference, defendants' only competitor in professional football, which thereby caused injury to the plaintiff in his business or property, was sufficient to sustain the complaint against a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action under the antitrust laws.
Read thus, the Radovich case is entirely consistent with Shotkin, Fedderson, and all other cases in which the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts have adhered to the requirement that a violation of the Sherman Act requires conduct of defendants by which the public is or conceivably may be ultimately injured.
45 Plaintiff cites us many cases involving group boycotts, discrimination, and the use of large scale buying power to drive out a competitor.
And he supplies us with many quotations which at first blush appear to support his position.
But each of his authorities involves factual situations entirely different from the one before us; factual situations in which the random phrases picked by plaintiff are proper and not inaccurate; they do not, however, support the contentions made here.
We are told that the antitrust laws are a trader's statute and cited to Mandeville Island Farms v. American Crystal Sugar Co. , 1948, 334 U.S. 219 , 68 S.Ct. 996 , 92 L.Ed. 1328 ; but that case holds that the antitrust statute "does not confine its protection to consumers, or to purchasers, or to competitors, or to sellers."
Id ., 334 U.S. at page 236 , 68 S.Ct. at page 1006 .
The statute, so Mandeville Island Farms decides, includes protection against the anti-competitive conduct of buyers also.
But the reason for such protection, is as always, fear of the detrimental effect on the public which these practices may have.
In holding that concerted action by processors directed against growers is barred by the antitrust laws, the Court did not intend such a phrase as protection of "all who are made victims of the forbidden practices" ( Id ., 334 U.S. at page 236 , 68 S.Ct. at page 1006 ) to be used to create a cause of action for a single competitor injured by action directed solely at him which has no substantial effect on competition.
Where there is no conceivable way in which a substantial segment of the public can be injured by the conduct attached, the Sherman Act is not violated.
Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader , supra .
The Mandeville Island Farms case is in no way contrary.
It is not authority for the proposition that conduct directed solely and exclusively at an individual competitor is illegal, unless the result is a substantial lessening of competition in the particular market involved.
46 In each of the "Theatre" cases relied on by plaintiff, defendants' conduct either did or was intended to eliminate the sole competitor in a particular market, was directed at one of a very small number of competitors, 47 or involved the use of large scale monopolistic power derived from nationwide enterprises to eliminate a competitor and thereby substantially affect competition in the local market area.
See, e. g., United States v. Schine Chain Theatres , 1948, 334 U.S. 110 , 68 S.Ct. 947 , 92 L.Ed. 1245 ; United States v. Griffith , 1948, 334 U.S. 100 , 68 S.Ct. 941 , 92 L.Ed. 1236 ; Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures , 1946, 327 U.S. 251 , 66 S.Ct. 574 , 90 L.Ed. 652 ; Binderup v. Path Exchange , 1923, 263 U.S. 291 , 44 S.Ct. 96 , 68 L.Ed. 308 ; Hart v. B. F. Keith Vaudeville Exchange , supra ; Paramount Film Distributing Corp. v. Village Theatre , 10 Cir., 1955, 228 F.2d 271 ; William Goldman Theatres v.

Finally to be considered are those cases cited to us in which price fixing or some other form of complete market control was involved and where defendants' conduct was directed at a particular class of persons of which plaintiff was one.
Here again it is clear that control or attempted control of all competitors is the evil which causes the contracts, combinations, or conspiracies to be the type prohibited by 1 of the statute.
These cases are not here applicable; the conduct involved either was intended to control the entire market and was directed at plaintiff because he refused to conform or was directed at an entire class of defendants' competitors, buyers, or sellers, one of whom was the plaintiff.
See, e. g., Radovich v. National Football League , supra ; Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons , 1951, 340 U.S. 211 , 71 S.Ct. 259 , 95 L.Ed. 219 ; International Salt Co. v. United States , 1947, 332 U.S. 392 , 68 S.Ct. 12 , 92 L.Ed. 20 ; Fashion Originators' Guild of America v. F.T.C.

Yost Lumber Co. , 8 Cir., 1941, 117 F.2d 53 .
Not one of the out of context quotations from the foregoing cases used by plaintiff will support his position when read within its factual setting.
Count one of the complaint, with which we are here solely concerned, alleges, in paragraph six, that defendant Broadway-Hale, in combination with each of the manufacturing-distributing defendants, prevented plaintiff from obtaining products to sell to the public.
There is no allegation of actual, attempted, or intended control of the market in which plaintiff and defendant Broadway-Hale competed, considering the market to be either the retail sellers of the Mission District of San Francisco, the city itself, or the purchasing public.
Defendants' affidavits, submitted under the provisions of Rule 56 of the Federal Rules, as well as the facts of which this Court may take judicial notice leave no doubt that the conduct directed at this particular plaintiff and only at this plaintiff did not and could not have under the circumstances any substantial effect on market competition.
As defendants point out there are literally hundreds of dealers in the San Francisco Bay Area dealing in the same kinds and brands of major appliances as plaintiff and defendant Broadway-Hale.
On Mission Street, along with the plaintiff and Broadway-Hale, there are over forty retail dealers.
Additionally, there are numerous brands of appliances to which plaintiff was not denied access and which compete favorably with those he was denied.
48 In light of our previous discussion, such allegations, especially when considered on motion for summary judgment rather than on motion for dismissal of the complaint, do not allege facts from which it can be inferred that there was or may be a substantial effect on competition, and therefore do not allege a violation of 1 of the antitrust laws--they do not state facts from which injury to the public can be perceived.
The first sentence of paragraph six of count one of plaintiff's complaint is of no assistance to appellant.
It alleges only that "defendants have restrained trade and commerce by contracting, combining, and conspiring together in restraint and monopoly of such trade and commerce and have thereby substantially lessened, limited and restrained competition in said trade and commerce.
*" This is no more than the pleader's conclusion that defendants have restrained trade and commerce by restraining trade and commerce.
It states no facts from which illegal action can be perceived or inferred.
Paragraph eight of count one speaks of Broadway-Hale's "monopolistic buying power" enjoyed "by reason of the large number of retail outlets it operates."
But the essence of this allegation is that Broadway-Hale "has purchased and continues to purchase the products of the manufacturer-distributor defendants upon the condition that the manufacturer-distributor defendants do not sell their products to the plaintiff."
We find no basis for determining that Broadway-Hale intended, or had the power if it so intended, to effect such conditions on its purchases in such scope as to appreciably affect competition among retailers generally in their purchases or sales to the public.
It is well known that appliance sales are within a most highly competitive market.
As between two dealers, one may be able to condition his purchases by requiring no sales to the other.
So long as the ability to so condition one's own purchases does not substantially interfere with either the "retailing public" or the "consuming public," there is no conduct which violates the provisions of the antitrust laws.
In determining whether certain conduct was "in restraint of trade or commerce," we re-emphasize what was said by the Court in Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader , supra , 310 U.S. at pages 493, 500 , 60 S.Ct. at page 992 : otherwise In other words, restraints, in order to be violative of the law, must operate, or be intended to operate, to restrict commercial competition in a substantial manner.
We believe this to be an accurate and controlling statement of the law applicable in determining whether particular conduct conceded to exist does or does not constitute a violation of the antitrust laws.
Neither Shotkin v. General Electric Co. , supra , and Fedderson Motors v. Ward , supra , nor the cases which follow and rely on them are to the contrary; nor does Radovich v. National Football League , supra , weaken or limit the conclusions derived from the Apex case.
We hold, therefore, that plaintiff's first cause of action, as proved, is fatally defective.
The facts prove no more than a squabble between two of many competitors in a highly competitive market area.
The facts prove no conduct in violation of the antitrust laws because there has been no conduct by which the "public" could conceivably suffer injury.
Construing the complaint and affidavits together, and considering the facts judicially known to this Court and the court below, the motion for summary judgment was properly granted.
The judgment is affirmed.
