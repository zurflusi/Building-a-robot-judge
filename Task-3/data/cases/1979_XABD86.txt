 ELY , Circuit Judge: These appeals stem from the efforts of two environment associations and two private citizens 1 to control the pumping of water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (the Delta) into the canals and aqueducts of the California Water Project.
The facts are reported fully in the excellent opinion of District Judge Renfrew.
Sierra Club v. Morton , 400 F.Supp.
610 (N.D.Cal.1975).
After the first phase of a bifurcated trial the District Court ordered the federal 2 and state 3 defendants to obtain authorization for the operation of their pumping plants from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps), pursuant to section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. 403 (1970).
The court also ordered the Secretary of the Army to prepare an environmental impact statement prior to the issuance of such authorization.
Id. at 651 .
In addition, the court enjoined construction on the proposed Peripheral Canal until an environmental impact statement was prepared and authorization from the Corps was obtained.
The Peripheral Canal would transfer water directly from the Sacramento River to a point close to the pumping plants.
Since the trial court has not yet conducted the relief phase of the bifurcated trial, it has not yet determined whether the appellees are entitled to further relief; accordingly, it has allowed the continuing operation of the pumping plants.
Here, the federal and state parties present five principal arguments.
First, they contend that the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. 401-418 (1970) (the Act), does not create a private right of action, and that, therefore, only the United States can enforce the permit requirements of section 10 .
4 Second, they contend that even if a private right of action exists, the appellees lacked standing to institute their suit.
Third, it is asserted that section 10 does not apply to the pumping of water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta; and fourth, if compliance with section 10 is required, such compliance already exists.
Finally, the federal parties argue that since their plant, the Tracy Pumping Plant, was fully operational before the enactment of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321-4347 (1970 & Supp. V 1975), no environmental impact statement is necessary if a section 10 permit is required.
Neither the federal nor the state parties challenge the District Court's ruling concerning the Peripheral Canal.
We have concluded that a private right of action should be implied on behalf of parties who seek to enforce compliance with the permit requirements of section 10 of the Act and that three of the four plaintiffs, having alleged particularized injuries, possess the requisite standing to avail themselves of that right.
We agree with the District Court that the pumping of Delta water falls within the broad reach of section 10 and that the state parties have been exporting Delta water in violation of that provision.
Unlike the District Court, however, we believe that Congress authorized the present operational level of the federal pumping plant, thereby excusing its operators from the section 10 permit requirement.
Because of this second conclusion, we do not reach the final issue, i. e., whether the federal parties would be legally required to prepare an environmental impact statement before granting a section 10 permit for the federal pumping plant.
We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.
I. FACTS The federal and state pumping plants are integral elements of the Central Valley and State Water Projects, which, together, constitute the California Water Project.
The Central Valley Project, administered by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, consists of dams, reservoirs, pumping plants, canals, and other facilities designed to generate hydroelectric power, provide flood control, and supply water for irrigation and other uses in the Central Valley of California.
To this end, water from the winter runoff is stored behind dams in the Sacramento River and then released, as needed, to flow down river and into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where it merges with other Delta waters.
The Tracy Pumping Plant, a principal component of the Central Valley Project, pumps water from the Delta into the Delta-Mendota Canal, a 115-mile canal leading to the Mendota pool in the Central Valley.
The pumping capacity of the Tracy Pumping Plant is 4,602 cubic feet per sceond.
In 1973 this plant pumped 2,127,341 acre-feet of water from the Delta.
The State Water Project, created by the Burns-Porter Act of 1959 and now codified in Cal. Water Code 12930-12942 (West 1971), is the state analogue to the Central Valley Project.
It also consists of dams, canals, pumping plants, and other facilities designed to generate power, provide flood control, and transfer water from the Delta to the more arid regions of central, coastal, and southern California.
The state pumping plant, known as the Delta Pumping Plant, is central to the operation of this water project.
Like the Tracy Pumping Plant, it withdraws water from the Delta, pumping it into a canal, where the water ultimately is permitted to flow to its place of use.
The pumping capacity of the Delta Pumping Plant is now approximately 6,300 cubic feet per second.
This capacity can be increased to approximately 10,300 cubic feet per second by the installation of additional pumping units, and it is contemplated that the first of these pumps will in fact be operational by 1980.
In 1973 the Delta Pumping Plant withdrew 1,261,120 acre-feet of water from the Delta.
The State of California, through its Department of Water Resources, has already entered into contracts providing that at some future time the State Water Project will annually deliver 4,230,000 acre-feet of water, of which 95 percent will be pumped by the Delta Pumping Plant.
With the addition of the Peripheral Canal the potential withdrawal of Delta water by both the Tracy and Delta Pumping Plants will increase to approximately 7,000,000 acre-feet in 1990 and approximately 7,750,000 acre-feet by 2020.
The pumping, past and present, has had a significant impact upon the Delta.
The District Court found de minimus 400 F.Supp.
at 632 .
5 Before we address whether this impact falls within the Corps' regulatory jurisdiction under section 10 , it is obvious that we must first determine whether plaintiffs, as private individuals, can enforce the permit requirements of that section.
6 II.
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION To determine whether a statute contains an implied private remedy, a court should consider four separate questions.
First, is the plaintiff a member of the "class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted?"
Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Rigsby , 241 U.S. 33, 39 , 36 S.Ct. 482, 484 , 60 L.Ed. 874 (1916).
Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create or to deny a private right of action?
Third, do the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme conflict with private enforcement of the act?
Fourth, and last, "is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of the States, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law?"
Cort v. Ash , 422 U.S. 66, 78 , 95 S.Ct. 2080, 2088 , 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975); see Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries , 430 U.S. 1, 37-41 , 97 S.Ct. 926 , 51 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977); Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Barbour , 421 U.S. 412 , 95 S.Ct. 1733 , 44 L.Ed.2d 263 (1975); National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Association of Railroad Passengers , 414 U.S. 453, 457-458 , 94 S.Ct. 690 , 38 L.Ed.2d 646 (1974); Starbuck v. City & County of San Francisco , 556 F.2d 450, 454 (9th Cir. 1977).
Although we have found no hard and precise indication of a congressional intent to create or deny a private remedy under section 10 , we believe, without significant doubt, that such a remedy does exist.
The plaintiffs below are members of a class for whose benefit Congress enacted the statute, and implication of a private remedy is both consistent with the purposes of the Act and complementary to its enforcement.
A. Beneficiaries of the Rivers and Harbors Act The plaintiffs in this case who use the Delta and the San Francisco Bay also belong to the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted.
Long ago, in 1888, the Supreme Court decided that federal common law did not prohibit obstructions and nuisances in navigable waters of the United States.
Willamette Iron Bridge Co. v. Hatch , 125 U.S. 1 , 8 S.Ct. 811 , 31 L.Ed. 629 (1888).
Therefore, the Court held that a private party could not obtain an injunction against the construction of a bridge over a navigable water.
Congress promptly responded by enacting section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1890, 26 Stat. 426 , 454, which forbids obstructions not affirmatively authorized by law.
This section, with minor changes, became section 10 of the 1899 Act.
Since that time, courts have granted relief to private parties who suffer special injury because of unauthorized obstructions.
For example, in Neches Canal Co. v. Miller & Vidor Lumber Co. , 24 F.2d 763 (5th Cir. 1928), a lumber company sued to recover losses caused by the construction of an unauthorized sand dam in the Neches River.
The company recovered the expense it had incurred in raising its logs, which had sunk in the river because of the obstruction.
In Tatum v. Blackstock , 319 F.2d 397 (5th Cir. 1963), a landowner with property adjacent to navigable waters sought to enjoin unauthorized dredging and filling, which would have altered the flow of the navigable waters to the detriment of his property.
The court upheld a preliminary injunction against further activity until the Corps of Engineers issued a permit.
Recently, our own court remanded for trial one of the consolidated appeals in Leslie Salt Co. v. Froehlke , 578 F.2d 742 (9th Cir. 1978), in which a private association contended that diked evaporation ponds in and around Bair Island in San Francisco Bay were built in violation of the Act because Corps permits had not been obtained.
7 The federal parties argue that only the federal government is a beneficiary of the Act, relying upon an isolated statement of the Supreme Court in Wyandotte Transportation Co. v. United States , 389 U.S. 191, 201 , 88 S.Ct. 379, 386 , 19 L.Ed.2d 407 (1967), that "a principal beneficiary of the Act, if not the principal beneficiary, is the Government itself."
Wyandotte , however, does not preclude private parties from also being recognized as beneficiaries of the Act.
8 Indeed, the Court's pronouncement, which expressly leaves open the class for whose benefit the Act was passed, was made in the context of expanding, not contracting, the remedies under the Act.
As the District Court succinctly stated, " Sections 9 and 10 were enacted both to prevent injuries to private parties as a result of obstructions to navigable capacity which were not authorized by the United States and to allow the United States to regulate obstructions to the navigable capacity of its navigable waterways."
400 F.Supp.
at 623 (footnote omitted).
B. Legislative Intent The legislative history of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 does not reflect a congressional intent either to afford a private remedy or to deny one.
9 Nor is the statutory language itself determinative.
Section 12 of the Act provides for the enforcement of section 10 , making a violation of section 10 a misdemeanor punishable by either a fine or imprisonment and authorizing a district court to enjoin the violation.
10 Section 17 of the Act, in conjunction with section 12 , places the duty of enforcement upon the Attorney General and the Department of Justice.
11 Normally, these express statutory provisions would imply that no other means of enforcement are intended, with only clear contrary evidence of a legislative intent to rebut this presumption.
See Securities Investor Corp. v. Barbour , supra , 421 U.S. at 419 , 95 S.Ct. 1733 ; National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Association of Railroad Passengers , supra , 414 U.S. at 458 , 94 S.Ct. 690 .
This principle, however, does not apply to the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.
The Supreme Court has consistently construed the Act's language in a manner apparently aimed toward effectuating the underlying statutory policies.
See, e. g. , Wyandotte Transp. Co. v. United States , supra , 389 U.S. at 201 , 88 S.Ct. 379 ; United States v. Republic Steel Corp. , 362 U.S. 482 , 80 S.Ct. 884 , 4 L.Ed.2d 903 (1960).
The Court has already determined that the penal provisions of the Act do not preclude implication of a civil action.
Cort v. Ash , supra , 422 U.S. at 79 , 95 S.Ct. 2080 .
Wyandotte Transp. Co. v. United States , supra , 389 U.S. at 201-202 , 88 S.Ct. 379 .
Accordingly, we believe that the Attorney General's enforcement responsibilities were not meant to foreclose the implication that private actions are authorized to promote the purposes of section 10 .
12 Rather, 13 10 Republic Steel Corp. , supra , 362 U.S. at 491 , 80 S.Ct. at 890 .
C. Consistency with Legislative Scheme Our third inquiry concerns the consistency of implying a private right of action under section 10 with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme.
We perceive a private right of action as both consistent with the purposes of the Rivers and Harbors Act and complementary to its enforcement.
Section 10 prohibits unreasonable obstructions to navigable capacity, and in those instances specifically enumerated in its second and third clauses, the statute directs the Secretary of the Army, acting upon the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers, to determine what constitutes an unreasonable obstruction.
Wisconsin v. Illinois , 278 U.S. 367, 413 , 49 S.Ct. 163 , 73 L.Ed. 426 (1929).
The underlying purpose of section 10 is clear.
That purpose is to keep the navigable waters of the United States free from unreasonable obstructions.
Private suits such as the present one promote this policy by assuring Corps review of those activities that could obstruct the navigable capacity of the Nation's waters by altering or modifying their course, condition, or capacity.
13 The District Court reasoned that exclusive enforcement of the criminal provisions should be vested in the Attorney General but that the Attorney General had neither the time nor the resources to seek redress for all violations of the Act.
400 F.Supp.
at 624-25 .
The court concluded that a private right of action was necessary to protect private parties who suffer special injuries because of these violations.
Id. at 625 .
We agree, 14 but we do not rest this conclusion solely upon recognition of the Attorney General's lack of resources.
An additional problem, exemplified by this case, is that the federal government, which is specifically directed to enforce the Act, may itself be charged with violating its provisions.
15 Unless private rights of action are permitted, federal violations could operate so as to wholly frustrate the purposes of the Act.
See Illinois ex rel.
Scott v. Hoffman , 425 F.Supp.
71, 75-76 (S.D.Ill.1977); cf. Miller v. Mallery , 410 F.Supp.
1283, 1289 (D.Or.1976).
Unlike the possible result faced by the Supreme Court in Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Barbour , supra , 421 U.S. 412 , 95 S.Ct. 1733 , 44 L.Ed.2d 263 , and National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Association of Railroad Passengers , supra , 414 U.S. 453 , 94 S.Ct. 690 , 38 L.Ed.2d 646 , implication of a private remedy under section 10 does not raise the spectre of judicial encroachment upon executive policymaking.
It is not here argued that the Corps cannot issue permits for the continued operation of the Tracy and Delta Pumping Plants.
The Corps can grant to the appropriate federal and state officers permission to continue their pumping operations.
If permits are properly obtained, the right of the appellees to enforce section 10 will not then extend so as to entitle them to obtain redress for their injury.
It remains true that the Congress and the Corps ultimately decide which activities affecting navigable waters are permissible.
16 D. State Law Finally, we hold that this case is not the type of action traditionally relegated to state law.
The appellants focus on allegations of the possible adverse effects upon fish and wildlife, contending that these are basically state concerns to be remedied under the law of nuisance.
This approach is much too narrow.
Activities affecting the navigable capacity of navigable waters of the United States are matters of federal, not state, law.
Wyandotte Transportation Co. v. United States , supra , 389 U.S. at 201 , 88 S.Ct. 379 .
We agree with the District Court that 400 F.Supp.
at 625 .
We emphasize, even though such emphasis should be unnecessary, that our decision does not permit private parties to enforce the criminal provisions of the Rivers and Harbors Act.
The Act does not authorize qui tam actions 17 to enforce its criminal penalties.
Section 17 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 413 (1970), vests exclusive enforcement of its penal provisions in the Department of Justice.
Jacklovich v. Interlake, Inc. , 458 F.2d 923 (7th Cir. 1972); Connecticut Action Now, Inc. v. Roberts Plating Co. , 457 F.2d 81 (2d Cir. 1972); Durning v. ITT Rayonier, Inc. , 325 F.Supp.
446 (W.D.Wash.1970).
Nor do we intend to hold that private parties may sue on behalf of the general public or seek to enjoin violations of section 13 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 407 (1970).
These questions are not before us, but there is good and sufficient reason to express our thought that this responsibility is also committed exclusively to the Department of Justice.
See Connecticut Action Now , supra at 88-89 ; Guthrie v. Alabama By-Products Co. , 328 F.Supp.
1140, 1144-48 (N.D.Ala.1971), aff'd , 456 F.2d 1294 (5th Cir. 1972), cert. denied , 410 U.S. 946 , 93 S.Ct. 1352 , 35 L.Ed.2d 613 (1973); Bass Angler Sportsman Society v. United States Steel Corp. , 324 F.Supp.
412, 416 (N.D., M.D., S.D.Ala.1971), aff'd , 447 F.2d 1304 (5th Cir. 1971) (per curiam).
Accordingly, we hold that private parties who suffer special injuries because of unauthorized activities affecting the navigable capacity of our Nation's waters may sue to enforce the permit requirements of section 10 .
There are no indicia of legislative intent to exclude a private right of action, and without this remedy, users of the Delta and the San Francisco Bay would be unable to obtain Corps review of the activities that are causing them injury.
III.
STANDING The intervening state water agencies contend that the appellees lacked standing to bring their action.
Under the Supreme Court cases of Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization , 426 U.S. 26 , 96 S.Ct. 1917 , 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976), and Warth v. Seldin , 422 U.S. 490 , 95 S.Ct. 2197 , 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975), as succinctly summarized by us in Bowker v. Morton , 541 F.2d 1347 (9th Cir. 1976), a plaintiff must allege "(a) a particularized injury (b) concretely and demonstrably resulting from defendants' action (c) which injury will be redressed by the remedy sought."
Id. at 1349 .
The individual appellees meet the standard.
18 Both have alleged a particularized injury caused by the pumping, and, although the injury may continue if the Corps eventually allows continued pumping, it may be redressed if the Corps restricts or regulates the pumping operation.
Unlike the plaintiffs in Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization , supra , 426 U.S. 26 , 96 S.Ct. 1917 , who sued the Secretary of the Treasury to contest a revenue ruling favorable to nonprofit hospitals offering only emergency room services to indigents, the individual plaintiffs' injury "can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant, and [is] not injury that results from the independent action of some third party not before the Court."
Simon , supra at 41-42 , 96 S.Ct. at 1926 .
19 The intervenors further contend that the appellees did not meet the second standing requirement, a nonconstitutional requirement, that "the interest sought to be protected by the complainant [is] arguably within the zone of interest to be protected or regulated by the statute in question."
Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp , 397 U.S. 150, 153 , 90 S.Ct. 827, 830 , 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970); Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization , supra , 426 U.S. at 39 , n.19, 96 S.Ct. 1917 .
The intervenors' argument is founded upon their belief that the zone of interest to be protected encompasses only navigational pursuits, a tenet that is incorrect.
Under section 10 the Corps must consider not only the effect of an activity upon navigation, but also its impact upon the environment.
United States v. Joseph G. Moretti, Inc. , 526 F.2d 1306, 1310 (5th Cir. 1976); Zabel v. Tabb , 430 F.2d 199, 213-14 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. denied , 401 U.S. 910 , 91 S.Ct. 873 , 27 L.Ed.2d 808 (1971).
We therefore hold that the appellees' interest in the environmental quality of the Delta and San Francisco Bay is within the zone of interests protected under the Rivers and Harbors Act.
See Alameda Conservation Association v. California , 437 F.2d 1087, 1091 (9th Cir.), cert. denied , 402 U.S. 908 , 91 S.Ct. 1380 , 28 L.Ed.2d 649 (1971) (standing for private party alleging injury to fish).
Because the individual appellees possess the requisite standing to maintain this suit, it would ordinarily be needless for us to consider whether the environmental associations also have standing.
Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. , 429 U.S. 252, 263-64 & n.9, 97 S.Ct. 555 , 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977).
Since the second portion of the bifurcated trial has not yet occurred, however, we think it desirable to offer some procedural guidelines to the District Court.
We shall address the issue briefly.
An organization's abstract concern with a subject is insufficient to confer the requisite standing, Sierra Club v. Morton , 405 U.S. 727 , 92 S.Ct. 1361 , 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972), but when the organization fails to allege an injury to itself as an organization, it can establish standing by showing that it represents individual members who have themselves suffered injury and who thus could have properly sued in their own right.
Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization , supra , 426 U.S. at 40 , 96 S.Ct. 1917 ; Warth v. Seldin , supra , 422 U.S. at 511 , 95 S.Ct. 2197 .
The Sierra Club has satisfied the test by alleging injuries to members who use the San Francisco Bay for boating and recreational purposes.
Friends of the Earth, on the other hand, has not met the requirement.
It has alleged nothing more than a general organizational interest in preservation of the environment.
20 Thus, it has no standing to invoke judicial resolution of the controversy.
The judgment of the District Court is vacated as to Friends of the Earth, and upon remand the District Court will dismiss the complaint as to Friends of the Earth.
IV.
SECTION 10 OF THE RIVERS AND HARBORS ACT OF 1899 We now turn to the merits.
First, the appellants attack the trial court's decision on the scope of section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.
21 The statute contains three distinct proscriptive clauses.
The first clause flatly prohibits the creation of any obstruction to "the navigable capacity of any of the waters of the United States" unless affirmatively authorized by Congress.
The second and third clauses, on the other hand, permit certain activities in navigable waters provided that they proceed on plans "recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of the Army."
These activities include the building of structures in navigable waters and the alteration or modification "in any manner" of the condition, capacity, or channel of any navigable water.
The District Court held that Section 10 400 F.Supp.
at 638 .
In so ruling, the court accepted the convincing factual evidence that export pumping by the Tracy and Delta facilities had lowered the level of navigable waters in the Delta by as much as 1.5 feet in at least one place and had caused net flow reversals in certain channels.
22 The District Court apparently believed that the controlling issue was whether a given diversion constituted an obstruction to navigable capacity.
23 We decline to adopt the District Court's approach, believing that it would necessarily present the courts with difficult definitional problems in a variety of factual contexts.
Instead, we interpret clauses 2 and 3 of section 10 as constituting a legislative enumeration of specific obstructions to navigable capacity that require Corps authorization.
In other words, the building activities mentioned in clauses 2 and 3 are presumed to be obstructions to navigable capacity.
Under the statute the Secretary of the Army determines whether these obstructions are reasonable.
Thus, the facts in this case should be analyzed from the standpoint of whether there has been any modification or alteration of the condition or capacity of a navigable stream, rather than first determining whether there has been an obstruction to navigable capacity.
24 When one undertakes any of the activities described in clause 2 or by his activities brings about any of the results specified in clause 3, he violates section 10 if he has not first sought and obtained a permit from the Corps of Engineers.
In Sanitary District v. United States , 266 U.S. 405 , 45 S.Ct. 176 , 69 L.Ed. 352 (1925), the Supreme Court, construing the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, held that the diversion of water from Lake Michigan by the Sanitary District of Chicago fell within the scope of section 10 and was therefore beyond the power of a state in the absence of specific authorization by the Corps of Engineers.
The Court referred to the fact that the Secretary of War had reviewed the Chicago Drainage Channel diversions in 1913, "including the obvious fact that so large a withdrawal would lower the levels of the Lakes and the overwhelming evidence that it would affect navigation."
Id. at 430 , 45 S.Ct. at 180 .
Nevertheless, Mr. Justice Holmes, for the Court, made no specific findings or determinations as to the effect on the actual navigable capacity of the lakes and rivers affected.
The Court wrote: 266 U.S. at 426, 429 , 45 S.Ct. at 179-180 .
Four years later, in Wisconsin v. Illinois , supra , 278 U.S. 367 , 49 S.Ct. 163 , 73 L.Ed. 426 , the Supreme Court again dealt with massive diversions by the Sanitary District of Chicago, which had lowered, by "not less than six inches," the levels of Lakes Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, their connecting waterways, and the St. Lawrence River above tidewater.
Id. at 400 , 49 S.Ct. 163 .
Chief Justice Taft wrote: section 10 Congress' purpose was a direct prohibition of what was forbidden by them except when affirmatively approved by the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of War in the second and third clauses of Section 10 what in the particular cases constituted an unreasonable obstruction 278 U.S. at 413 , 49 S.Ct. at 170 (emphasis added).
In short, the Corps must authorize any of the structures or activities enumerated in clauses 2 and 3, which are presumed to constitute obstructions.
The need for applying to the Corps for a permit does not depend on some prior determination that there has been an obstruction to navigable capacity.
Even more explicit is the opinion of the Supreme Court in United States v. Republic Steel Corp. , supra , 362 U.S. 482 , 80 S.Ct. 884 .
There, the Court held that the unauthorized deposit of industrial solids in the Calumet River, which reduced its depth by four to nine feet in some places, constituted an obstruction to navigable capacity and thus a violation of section 10 .
The Court carefully distinguished between the three clauses of the section: 10 We can only conclude that Congress planned to ban any type of "obstruction," not merely those specifically made subject to approval by the Secretary of the Army.
It seems, moreover, that the first clause being specifically aimed at "navigable capacity" serves an end that may at times be broader than those served by the other clauses.
Some structures mentioned in the second clause may only deter movements in commerce, falling short of adversely affecting navigable capacity.
And navigable capacity of a waterway may conceivably be affected by means other than the excavations and fills mentioned in the third clause 10 In short, the first clause is aimed at protecting "navigable capacity," though it is adversely affected in ways other than those specified in the other clauses 362 U.S. at 486-87 , 80 S.Ct. at 887-888 (emphasis added).
Clearly, the structures and activities set forth in the second and third clauses need not be shown to obstruct navigable capacity before federal authorization is required by the terms of the statute.
Finally, recent Fifth Circuit authority has established beyond cavil that an alteration or modification of navigable waters is sufficient to trigger the permit requirement of section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act.
In United States v. Joseph G. Moretti, Inc. ( Moretti I ), 478 F.2d 418, 429 n.37 (5th Cir. 1973), the Fifth Circuit held that "any filling of navigable waters creates an obstruction to navigation."
When the same party came before the Fifth Circuit again, the court held that to trigger the permit requirements of the third clause of section 10 , a party need only prove United States v. Joseph G. Moretti, Inc. ( Moretti II ), 526 F.2d 1306, 1309 (5th Cir. 1976); 25 accord , Weiszmann v. District Engineer, United States Army Corps of Engineers , 526 F.2d 1302, 1305 (5th Cir. 1976); United States v. Sexton Cove Estates, Inc. , 526 F.2d 1293, 1296-99 (5th Cir. 1976).
The state appellants and intervenors, however, present another argument in support of their interpretation of section 10 .
They argue that Congress has left to the states the regulation of water rights, including direct water supply diversions, and that Section 10 Section 10 Intervenors' Brief, supra note 24, at 46.
See also State Opening Brief, supra note 22, at 14-20.
To support their argument, those parties cite various congressional enactments, primarily in the area of reclamation, which contain generalized statements announcing a congressional policy of federal noninterference in state water laws and rights.
26 The case authority interpreting the reclamation statutes makes it clear to us that a principal purpose of such reference to state law "is to leave to state law the definition of the property interests, if any, for which compensation must be made" when these state or private rights and interests are acquired by eminent domain.
City of Fresno v. California , 372 U.S. 627, 629-30 , 83 S.Ct. 996, 998 , 10 L.Ed.2d 28 (1963) (emphasis added).
The Supreme Court, analyzing the effect on the California Central Valley Project of broad language recognizing state water rights in section 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902, 27 explained: State of] Nebraska v. [State of] Wyoming 325 U.S. 589, 615 65 S.Ct. 1332 89 L.Ed. 1815 Ivanhoe Irrigation Dist. v. McCracken , 357 U.S. 275, 291 , 78 S.Ct. 1174, 1183-1184 , 2 L.Ed.2d 1313 (1958).
Similarly, in United States v. Gerlach Live Stock Co. , 339 U.S. 725 , 70 S.Ct. 955 , 94 L.Ed. 1231 (1950), the Supreme Court specifically held that section 8 of the 1902 Act reflected a congressional intent, for the purposes of the Act, not to take water rights without compensation under the navigational servitude.
Id. at 737-39 , 70 S.Ct. 955 .
As the Court has recently indicated, just last Term, the general restriction on federal action embodied in section 10 is that the Secretary of the Interior must "appropriate, purchase, or condemn necessary water rights in strict conformity with state law."
California v. United States , 438 U.S. 645, 665 , 98 S.Ct. 2985, 2996 , 57 L.Ed.2d 1018 (1978).
In that case, the Court, correcting some confusion concerning the scope of section 8 engendered by its prior opinions, ruled that the recognition of State law mandated by section 8 is not limited to situations in which the United States acquires water rights: Section 8 438 U.S. at 674-75 , 98 S.Ct. at 3001 .
Therefore, the State of California was permitted to impose any conditions on the United States Bureau of Reclamation's appropriation of water from the Central Valley Project that did not conflict with clear congressional directives authorizing the project.
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, emphasized that state water law governs federal operation of reclamation projects only to the extent that Congress has chosen not to legislate otherwise.
The Court reaffirmed the validity of the basic holdings of Ivanhoe , supra , 357 U.S. 275 , 78 S.Ct. 1174 , 2 L.Ed.2d 1313 , and Fresno , supra , 372 U.S. 627 , 83 S.Ct. 996 , 10 L.Ed.2d 28 , i. e., that specific congressional directives concerning reclamation override state law to the extent that there is a conflict between the two bodies of authority.
438 U.S. at 670-72 , 98 S.Ct. at 2999 ; see id. at 670 n.23, 671 n.24, 98 S.Ct. 2985 .
Section 8 of the 1902 Reclamation Act and the other statutory provisions for federal deference to state water rights do not lend support to the novel suggestion made by the appellants despite the new vitality given those provisions by California v. United States .
The congressional policy of compliance with state law for the appropriation, purchase, condemnation, and distribution of water rights, in the absence of express congressional provision to the contrary, cannot be lifted from the context of reclamation so as to encroach upon the express provisions of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a statute directly concerned with obstructions to and modifications of navigable waters, enacted under the congressional power over commerce and navigation .
Cf. Gerlach , supra , 339 U.S. at 731-42 , 70 S.Ct. 955 .
The Rivers and Harbors Act, of course, does not itself mention noninterference with state-authorized water supply diversion operations.
The appellants point to no authority supporting their interpretation of section 10 , under which the Act assertedly is to be applied differently in situations in which a state has authorized water diversions.
In United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co. , 174 U.S. 690 , 19 S.Ct. 770 , 43 L.Ed. 1136 (1899), a case upon which the appellants attach some reliance, the Supreme Court clearly recognized that the federal authority over navigable waters delegated by Congress to the Corps under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1890, the predecessor of the 1899 Act, overrides any state power to authorize a water diversion project that would adversely affect navigation.
The power of states over waters within their dominions, the Court held 174 U.S. at 703 , 19 S.Ct. at 775 .
The Court observed that prior to 1890 Congress, through legislation, "recognized and assented to the appropriation of water" by states and private entities organized under state law, but ruled that the Rivers and Harbors Act controlled the issue insofar as any conflict existed.
Referring to the 1890 Act, the Court wrote: nonnavigable navigable waters nothing should be done to obstruct their navigability without the assent of the National Government The language is general, and must be given full scope anything, wherever done or however done which tends to destroy the navigable capacity 174 U.S. at 708 , 19 S.Ct. at 777 (emphasis added).
In Sanitary District v. United States , supra , 266 U.S. 405 , 45 S.Ct. 176 , 69 L.Ed. 352 , the Supreme Court specifically dealt with state diversions of water for public health purposes, describing as plenary the power of Congress to remove what it identifies as obstructions to interstate and foreign commerce.
There is no question that this power is superior to that of the States to provide for the welfare or necessities of their inhabitants 266 U.S. at 425-26 , 45 S.Ct. at 178-179 (emphasis added).
While states undeniably possess broad power to regulate their own navigable waters for the general welfare, the power clearly is, and should be subordinate to the federal navigational power unless Congress expressly defers to the state authority in the context of a specific statute.
Since Congress did not so defer to state authority in the case of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the State of California's powers over navigable waters cannot narrow the authority of the Corps over navigable waters as applied to state water diversions.
28 In sum, we hold that the lowering of water levels, as established in this case, amounts to an alteration or modification of the condition or capacity of Delta waters under clause 3 of section 10 , and thus requires authorization by the Corps.
This result follows without regard to the effect of the pumping plants on actual navigable capacity because a prior finding of obstruction to navigable capacity is not necessary in order to trigger the effect of clauses 2 and 3 of section 10 .
The federal authority set forth in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 reigns paramount.
Congressional deference to traditional state regulation of water rights, a consideration of significance in other contexts, does not operate to restrict the express policy of section 10 .
V. AUTHORIZATION Having determined that the construction and operation of the Tracy and Delta Plants require the approval of the Corps under section 10 , the District Court then ruled that both facilities lacked the required authorization.
The respective appellants offer different arguments in respect to the Tracy Pumping Plant, a federal facility, and the California's Delta Pumping Plant.
The federal appellants contend that various congressional acts affirmatively authorized the Tracy Plant under section 10 , clause 1.
The state appellants maintain that various section 10 permits issued over the years for certain components of the Delta Plant constitute authorization for the entire Delta Plant.
In addition, the state appellants urge that a Federal Power Commission license for portions of the California Water Project eliminated any need to obtain section 10 approval.
Other contentions made by the appellants in the District Court are not pressed on this appeal.
We first consider the question of congressional authorization of the Tracy Pumping Plant.
A. Congressional Authorization of the Tracy Pumping Plant .
The trial court found no congressional authorization of the Tracy Pumping Plant.
It based its decision on the legal conclusion that "[t]he initial authorization to create an obstruction must rest on express and not implied Congressional authority.
.
.
.
The approval or funding of a facility does not compromise Congress's right to control its operation."
400 F.Supp.
at 637 ( citing Sanitary District v. United States , supra , 266 U.S. at 428 , 45 S.Ct. 176 , and Hubbard v. Fort , 188 F. 987, 996 (C.C.D.N.J.1911).
29 The rationale of the District Court sweeps too broadly.
In our view, congressional approval or authorization may be found in virtually any type of statute, including appropriations statutes, so long as it is demonstrated that Congress had knowledge of the precise action or project at issue and was explicitly and specifically addressing that project.
United States v. Arizona , 295 U.S. 174 , 55 S.Ct. 666 , 79 L.Ed. 1371 (1935), casts light upon the principle.
There, the Supreme Court held that the Parker Dam, which the United States planned to build in the Colorado River between Arizona and California, was not authorized by any congressional act, as required by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.
The Government, contending that Congress had approved the dam, cited a 1904 Act authorizing the diversion of Colorado River waters for the purpose of irrigating adjoining lands on Indian reservations.
Id. at 185 , 55 S.Ct. 666 .
In support of its construction, the Government asserted that under the 1904 Act another structure, the Laguna Dam, had previously been built across the Colorado.
Rejecting the Government's argument, the Supreme Court pointed out that "Congress has made appropriations for the benefit of the project of which it [the Laguna Dam] is a part and so recognized and approved the building of the dam," citing Acts of 1916, 1917, and 1918 making appropriations for the Yuma Project, Arizona-California, which includes the Laguna Dam.
Id. at 186 n.5, 55 S.Ct. 666 .
As to the Parker Dam, however, the Court refused to hold that Congress had authorized the project under the 1904 Act "by making appropriations for irrigation of lands in Indian reservations."
Id.
Unlike the situation in our case, the 1904 Act did not specifically address the project at issue.
Compare Rivers and Harbors Act of 1937, ch.
832, 50 Stat. 844 , 850, quoted at n.31 infra , with Act of Apr. 21, 1904, 25 , 33 Stat. 224 .
United States v. Arizona , supra , teaches that Congress, while it may authorize a project by means of general appropriations legislation, must have known and intended that the specific facility in question was a part of the project for which it was making appropriations.
This interpretation is supported by other cases holding that Congress may authorize activities by means of appropriations legislation that specifically and directly relates to the projects in question.
30 We also note that the Corps' administrative regulations governing issuance of permits are consistent with this principle: Section 10 Section 10 Section 10 the legislative history and/or provisions of the Act should clearly demonstrate that Congress was approving the exact location and plans from which Congress could have considered the effect on navigable waters Section 10 33 C.F.R. 322.3(c)(1) (1978) (emphasis added).
Generally, a court should accord great weight to the construction of a statute by the agency responsible for its administration.
E. g. , California v. United States , supra , 438 U.S. at 676 n.30, 98 S.Ct. 2985 ; Zemel v. Rusk , 381 U.S. 1, 11 , 85 S.Ct. 1271 , 14 L.Ed.2d 179 (1965); Udall v. Tallman , 380 U.S. 1, 16 , 85 S.Ct. 792 , 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965).
The question thus narrows itself to whether the various congressional statutes and legislative history concerning the Central Valley Project are so sufficiently specific as to the Tracy Pumping Plant as to constitute congressional authorization under section 10 .
In our view, the basic enactments authorizing the Central Valley Project in 1937 and the annual appropriations acts for operation and maintenance of the Central Valley Project, when read in light of the legislative history of the broad oversight exercised by the Congress over the project, constitute affirmative authorization of the Tracy Plant.
The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1937, ch.
832, 2 , 50 Stat. 844 , 850, reauthorized the entire Central Valley Project, theretofore authorized and established under the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 115 .
31 As of 1937, then, Congress had clearly authorized the Central Valley Project, the general plans of which contemplated a large-scale diversion of water from the Delta to the San Joaquin Valley.
Subsequently, Congress enacted the Reclamation Project Act of 1939, ch.
418, 53 Stat. 1187 (codified at 43 U.S.C. 375a , 387-389, 485-485h, 485i-485k (1970)).
Section 9(a) of the Act, 43 U.S.C. 485h(a) (1970), provides that federal reclamation projects were to become automatically authorized when the Secretary of the Interior found them to be feasible and submitted a favorable report to the President and to the Congress.
32 On February 24, 1947, the Secretary of the Interior forwarded to Congress a Finding of Feasibility pursuant to the 1939 Reclamation Act.

No.146, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.
(1947), reprinted in Engle, Central Valley Project Documents , H.R.

No. 416, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., pt.
1, at 574 (1956).
The feasibility report contained a detailed discussion of the Delta-Mendota Canal, the 115-mile canal connecting the Mendota Pool in the San Joaquin Valley with the Tracy Pumping Plant.
The initial contract for construction of the Delta-Mendota Canal was dated June 14, 1946, and the canal's construction was completed prior to July 1, 1952.
The initial construction contract for the Tracy Pumping Plant was made on June 23, 1947, with construction of the Plant completed prior to February 1, 1953.
Over the years Congress has repeatedly appropriated funds for the Tracy facilities.
These appropriations acts have generally lumped together funds for the Central Valley Project as a whole.
As such, the situation appears to come within the dictum of United States v. Arizona that "Congress has made appropriations for the benefit of the project of which it is a part and so recognized and approved the building" of the project under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.
United States v. Arizona , supra , 295 U.S. at 186 , 55 S.Ct. 666, at 670 (emphasis added).
33 It is manifest from the legislative history that Congress was well aware of the Tracy Pumping Plant as part of the Central Valley Project, fully approved of it, and consistently encouraged its construction and operation.
34 In 1960 Congress authorized the construction of the San Luis Unit of the Central Valley Project.
Act of June 3, 1960, Pub.L.No.86-488, 74 Stat. 156 .
In section 4 of the Act Congress expressly noted the precise location and plans of the Tracy Pumping Plant as a critical and integral part of the San Luis Unit project.
35 There is no evidence whatsoever that Congress intended to authorize the San Luis Unit if, and only if, the Corps of Engineers subsequently issued a section 10 permit on its own for either the construction or operation of the Tracy Plant.
The District Court distinguished the 1960 Act on the ground that it was enacted after the commencement of the operation of the Tracy Plant, "and hence even if it were intended as Congressional consent, the original construction and operation of the Tracy Plant were unlawful."
400 F.Supp.
at 637 n.41.
We disagree.
In Wisconsin v. Duluth , 96 U.S. 379 , 24 L.Ed. 668 (1878), the Supreme Court upheld congressional authorization of a previously inaugurated private project on the basis of an appropriations act.
The Court reasoned that it would unreasonably reasonably restrict Congress' power to hold that Congress could not retroactively approve previously unauthorized projects.
We are therefore constrained to hold that the statutes and legislative history sufficiently demonstrate congressional approval of the Tracy Pumping Plant and its operation, both at the initiation of the Central Valley Project and, retroactively, after the completion of the plant.
36 B. Corps Authorization of the Delta Pumping Plant In the District Court the state appellants contended that various section 10 permits issued with respect to components of the Delta Pumping Plant constituted Corps authorization of the plant itself.
Here, they limit their argument to Permit No. 4101, issued in June 1967, which authorized the construction of the Clifton Court Forebay.
This forebay, a reservoir between the Delta and the pumping plant, was designed to allow the pumping to be confined to off-peak electrical hours.
Its only function is to serve as an intake facility for the Delta Pumping Plant.
Plainly, the permit does not authorize the entire Delta Pumping Plant.
No direct evidence in the permit file refers to the pumping plant, and the permit itself only authorized the State "to cut the westerly levee, of West Canal, at Clifton Court Tract for Clifton Court Forebay in Contra Costa County, California."
Nor can we construe the permit as implicit authorization for the Delta Plant.
The Corps regulations required that a permit application be complete and without reference to any unattached correspondence.
33 C.F.R. 209.130(b)(6) (1967).
Maps and plans showing the location, extent, and character of the project were considered essential, and the proposed work was to be indicated in red ink.
33 C.F.R. 209.130(c)(1) , (c)(11) (1967).
Given the completeness required of the application and the absence of any mention of the Delta Plant therein, we cannot appropriately say that the permit implicitly authorized more than the approved application upon which it was based.
37 The state appellants also contend that a Federal Power Commission (FPC) license for portions of the California Water Project eliminated the need for a section 10 permit.
Had the FPC granted a license covering the Delta Pumping Plant, their position would have some support.
See Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Callaway , 370 F.Supp.
162, 164-68 (S.D.N.Y.1973), aff'd , 499 F.2d 127 (2d Cir. 1974).
But the FPC did not license the Delta Pumping Plant.
Instead, it expressly and specifically declined to "extend our jurisdiction beyond those facilities actually constructed for power purposes so as to include hundreds of miles of canals, pumping stations and other associated facilities unrelated to the production of power."
Department of Water Resources of the State of California, 51 F.P.C.
529, 533 (1974).
The Corps of Engineers has promulgated regulations to govern situations in which its jurisdiction overlaps with that of the FPC.
When a project is subject to FPC regulation, the Corps fulfills its duty of protecting navigable waters by recommending to the FPC the inclusion of appropriate provisions rather than by directly issuing a Corps permit; however, "as to any other activities in navigable waters not constituting construction, operation and maintenance of physical structures licensed by the FPC .
.
.
the provisions of 33 U.S.C. 401 et seq.
remain fully applicable."
33 C.F.R. 320.3(f) (1978).
The FPC agrees that its license does not necessarily extend to all facilities of a project.
In its opinion concerning the California Water Project, the FPC cautioned that "[t]he mere fact that various facilities are proposed for licensing by an applicant is not sufficient reason to assume that all such facilities are properly the subject of a license."
The FPC also said, "[W]hen a particular facility is no longer part of the power project itself, it is not subject to our licensing jurisdiction."
Department of Water Resources of the State of California, 51 F.P.C.
529, 533 (1974).
Thus, both the Corps and the FPC have said that the State should apply to the Corps for a permit for construction of a water transportation facility unrelated to power production.
Their construction of the interrelationship between the Federal Power Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act is entitled to much deference, and we will follow it here.
See Chemehuevi Tribe of Indians v. FPC , 420 U.S. 395, 409-10 , 95 S.Ct. 1066 , 43 L.Ed.2d 279 (1975).
Although we reject the contentions of the state appellants as to the effect of Permit No. 4101 and the FPC license, it is conceivable that the State may still be excused from obtaining a permit for the operation of the Delta Pumping Plant.
Present regulations of the Corps of Engineers contain a grandfather clause that dispenses with the need to obtain individual section 10 authorization for certain structures.
The regulation provides, in pertinent part: Section 10 provided 33 C.F.R. 332.4(g) (1978) (emphasis added).
38 The District Court found that 400 F.Supp.
at 620-21 .
Because the record on appeal does not reflect whether the pumping plant itself was completed prior to December 18, 1968, and the parties have not yet addressed the question, this question should first be considered by the District Court.
At this time we express no opinion as to the validity of the Corps regulation.
All such arguments should be presented in the first instance to the District Court.
If the District Court finds that the Delta Pumping Plant was completed prior to December 18, 1968, the above regulation will exempt the State from obtaining an individual section 10 permit, provided that the facility does not interfere with navigation and so long as the regulation may be held to be a valid exercise of the Corps' authority.
VI.
CONCLUSION In summary, we hold that parties who suffer special injury have a private right of action to enforce compliance with the permit requirements of section 10 .
Sierra Club and the two individual appellees have standing to avail themselves this private right of action.
We have already explained why, as to Friends of the Earth, the judgment was to be vacated and its complaint dismissed.
On the merits, the Tracy and Delta Pumping Plants fall within the ambit of section 10 , since their operation has altered navigable waters of the United States.
Because Congress affirmatively authorized the Tracy Pumping Plant, a Corps permit is not required for its present operational level.
Therefore, we do not reach the question of whether an environmental impact statement is required for the Tracy Plant.
The Delta Pumping Plant, which has not been authorized by Congress, must obtain a Corps permit for its operation, unless exempted by the Corps regulation, 33 C.F.R. 322.4(g) (1978).
39 To the District Court, we accord the discretion to allow the pumping to continue at its present level pending the filing and processing of the permit application.
Traditional equitable principles apply.
