 PER CURIAM (on reconsideration).
When we originally considered this declaratory judgment action in which determinations of the validity of an attorney's contingent fee contract and of the reasonableness of an attorney's fee in a will-contest case are sought, we held that the plaintiff was entitled to a jury trial on the issues of fact.
Simler v. Conner , 10 Cir., 282 F.2d 382 .
Thereafter the United States Supreme Court vacated our judgment and remanded the case "for reconsideration in the light of Southard v. MacDonald , Okl., 360 P.2d 940 ."
Conner v. Simler , 367 U.S. 486 , 81 S.Ct. 1679 , 6 L.Ed.2d 1241 .
In the Southard case the Supreme Court of Oklahoma held: Southard v. MacDonald 360 P.2d 940, 941 Unless the contingent fee contract in this case is held to be invalid the value of the services on a quantum meruit basis does not arise, and Conner is entitled to one-half of any recovery resulting from the legal services rendered in connection with the will contest matter.
The basic relief sought is the cancellation of the contract; therefore the action is purely equitable in nature, and should be determined by the court without a jury.
As to the appropriateness of the trial court's summary judgment our views remain as expressed in the former opinion.
Reversed and remanded for trial without a jury.
