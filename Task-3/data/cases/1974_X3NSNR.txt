 ALFRED T. GOODWIN , Circuit Judge: Colin F. MacCollom appeals from the dismissal of his action for declaratory and injunctive relief.
He seeks preparation, at government expense, of a verbatim transcript of his criminal trial to assist him in the preparation of a postconviction motion under 28 U.S.C. 2255 .
We hold that he has the right to such a transcript, reverse, and remand the case. MacCollom was convicted in the United States district court and was confined in 1970.
Because he took no appeal, MacCollom did not request a transcript until March 1972, when he filed a "motion for transcript in forma pauperis."
The clerk of the court notified MacCollom that until he filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. 2255 , the court had no power to act on his request.
MacCollom then filed his complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief.
His motion to proceed in forma pauperis was granted, and an attorney was appointed to assist him; but, on the government's motion, the district court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
Counsel has candidly argued that he cannot represent to the court that specific constitutional grounds for relief exist until after he has seen a transcript.
The present state of the law seems to tell him that he must discover some constitutional claim and assert it before he can see the transcript.
The right of an indigent to receive at government expense a stenographic transcript of his criminal trial has been the subject of a number of Supreme Court decisions over the past eighteen years. 1 Beginning with Griffin v. Illinois , 351 U.S. 12 , 76 S.Ct. 585 , 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956), the Court has consistently held that "[d]estitute defendants must be afforded as adequate appellate review as defendants who have money enough to buy transcripts."
351 U.S. at 19 , 76 S.Ct. at 591 .
Later cases, reasoning from equal-protection and due-process principles have expanded the indigent's right to a free transcript for use in a direct appeal.
Eskridge v. Washington State Board of Prison Terms & Paroles , 357 U.S. 214 , 78 S.Ct. 1061 , 2 L.Ed.2d 1269 (1958) (per curiam), held that a trial transcript, which under Washington procedure had to be filed with an appeal, could not be denied merely because the trial judge did not believe that an appeal would promote justice.
Five years later, in Draper v. Washington , 372 U.S. 487 , 83 S.Ct. 774 , 9 L.Ed.2d 899 (1963), a revised Washington procedure came up for review.
There, the Court held that a trial judge's determination that an indigent's appeal was frivolous could not be substituted for appellate examination of a record full enough for the appellate court to draw its own conclusions.
The next year, in Hardy v. United States , 375 U.S. 277 , 84 S.Ct. 424 , 11 L.Ed.2d 331 (1964), the Court held on statutory grounds that in the federal courts an attorney newly appointed on appeal was entitled to a full trial transcript.
Five years later, the Court extended Griffin to include an appeal from a drunken-driving conviction.
Williams v. Oklahoma City , 395 U.S. 458 , 89 S.Ct. 1818 , 23 L.Ed.2d 440 (1969) (per curiam).
Finally, in Mayer v. City of Chicago , 404 U.S. 189 , 92 S.Ct. 410 , 30 L.Ed.2d 372 (1971), the Court reaffirmed its earlier holdings, stating that though a state need not provide an indigent with a trial transcript if other alternatives would provide him with adequate and effective appellate review, when the appellant shows a colorable need for the full transcript, the state has the burden of showing that only part of it or some substitute would be adequate.
Meanwhile, Griffin 's constitutional principle was being extended to appeals from the denial of collateral relief.
In Lane v. Brown , 372 U.S. 477 , 83 S.Ct. 768 , 9 L.Ed.2d 892 (1963), the Court held that a state prisoner was entitled to an appeal from the denial of a writ of error coram nobis in state court, even though the public defender who represented him at the time that the writ was denied believed that an appeal was useless and refused to order the required transcript.
Two years later, in Long v. District Court of Iowa , 385 U.S. 192 , 87 S.Ct. 362 , 17 L.Ed.2d 290 (1966), the Court held that an indigent state habeas petitioner was entitled to a transcript of the hearing on his petition in order to appeal a denial of the writ.
(Because a full transcript of the hearing was available, the Court did not consider whether a substitute would suffice.)
Finally, in Gardner v. California , 393 U.S. 367 , 89 S.Ct. 580 , 21 L.Ed.2d 601 (1969), the Court held that where state law did not permit an unsuccessful habeas applicant to appeal directly but did permit him to file a new petition at the next appellate level, the state must furnish a verbatim record of the first habeas hearing, absent a showing that an alternative would be an adequate substitute.
Other Supreme Court decisions conferred the rights to a free transcript of a preliminary hearing, Roberts v. LaVallee , 389 U.S. 40 , 88 S.Ct. 194 , 19 L.Ed.2d 41 (1967) (per curiam), and stated that where an adequate alternative did not exist the defendant was entitled to a transcript of a mistrial.
Britt v. North Carolina , 404 U.S. 226 , 92 S.Ct. 431 , 30 L.Ed.2d 400 (1971).
Where a state prisoner petitions federal courts for habeas corpus relief, the federal district court must hold an evidentiary hearing to make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law, if the petitioner did not receive a full and fair hearing on the merits of his claim in state court.
In order to determine whether such a hearing was provided, the district court has the power to compel production of the complete state-court record, including a transcript of the testimony.
Hence, a state prisoner who files a federal habeas petition is entitled to that portion of the state-court transcript relevant to a determination of the facts contested by him.
See Townsend v. Sain , 372 U.S. 293 , 83 S.Ct. 745 , 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963); 28 U.S.C. 2254(e) .
The Supreme Court has not specifically decided whether an indigent state prisoner, who has not stated precisely what errors he claims in his state-court conviction, must be provided with a free transcript of his original trial for use in a collateral proceeding.
That question was raised, but not reached, in Wade v. Wilson , 396 U.S. 282 , 90 S.Ct. 501 , 24 L.Ed.2d 470 (1970).
2 There, the petitioner had used a borrowed transcript on his direct appeal, and, before the Court would decide whether a free copy must be supplied for purposes of the habeas proceeding, it required him to show that a transcript could not again be borrowed.
The precise question before this court--whether an indigent federal prisoner is entitled to a free transcript of his criminal trial to assist him in the preparation of a postconviction motion under 28 U.S.C. 2255 --has not been decided by the Supreme Court.
Other federal appellate courts, however, have held that a federal prisoner is not entitled to a free transcript under these circumstances, in the absence of a showing of need for the specific portion of the transcript which he requests.
See, e. g. , Cowan v. United States , 445 F.2d 855 (5th Cir. 1971); Bentley v. United States , 431 F.2d 250 (6th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 920 , 91 S.Ct. 907 , 27 L.Ed.2d 823 (1971); Benthiem v. United States , 403 F.2d 1009 (1st Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 945 , 90 S.Ct. 384 , 24 L.Ed.2d 247 (1969); United States v. Shoaf , 341 F.2d 832 (4th Cir. 1964).
3 This circuit did hold in Wilson v. Wade , 390 F.2d 632 (9th Cir. 1968), that an indigent state prisoner was not entitled to a free transcript in order to search for some basis for postconviction relief.
We relied then upon what we conceded may have been dicta in McGarry v. Fogliani , 370 F.2d 42, 44 (9th Cir. 1967).
See Wilson v. Wade , 390 F.2d at 634 n. 1.
However, our judgment in Wilson v. Wade was vacated by the Supreme Court, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.
396 U.S. 282 , 90 S.Ct. 501 , 24 L.Ed.2d 470 (1970).
Taylor v. United States , 238 F.2d 409 (9th Cir. 1956), cert. denied, 353 U.S. 938 , 77 S.Ct. 817 , 1 L.Ed.2d 761 (1957), is the only decision of this court involving the right of an indigent prisoner to obtain a free transcript for use in a 2255 proceeding.
We denied the petitioner's request there, but that decision was handed down in 1956 only months after Griffin v. Illinois had been decided and before most of the case law in the free-transcript field had been developed.
To the extent that Taylor may have been stating a constitutional doctrine, it has been thoroughly undercut by subsequent higher authority.
Moreover, Taylor is inconsistent with the prevailing rule in other circuits that an indigent prisoner in a 2255 proceeding is entitled to a free transcript if he can make a particularized showing of need.
In Taylor the petitioner alleged that the government knowingly used perjured testimony to procure his conviction and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.
Under current practice at least the first allegation probably would be sufficient to require production of the relevant portions of the transcript.
Cf. United States v. McDowell , 305 F.2d 12, 14 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 927 , 83 S.Ct. 296 , 9 L.Ed.2d 508 (1962).
Congress had endorsed the rule, initially adopted by the Fourth Circuit, that an indigent federal prisoner must make a particularized showing of need before he can obtain a free transcript of his criminal trial.
Title 28 U.S.C. 753(f) provides: 18 U.S.C. 3006A section 2255 However, for us to grant MacCollom the relief he seeks would not require us to declare section 753(f) unconstitutional.
The second quoted sentence merely authorizes under certain circumstances the payment of fees for transcripts furnished in 2255 proceedings.
The section does not prohibit courts from also requiring the government to supply an imprisoned indigent with a free transcript before he files a 2255 motion.
Such a court order would simply fill a constitutional deficit not addressed by the statute.
The sentence in 28 U.S.C. 753(f) referring to proceedings brought under 2255 was added in 1965 (Act of Sept. 2, 1965, Pub.L.No.89-167, 79 Stat. 647) to resolve a division of opinion among the circuits as to whether federal courts had the power, under the preceding sentence referring to habeas corpus petitions, to order transcripts for use in section 2255 proceedings.
Compare United States v. Glass , 317 F.2d 200 (4th Cir. 1963), with United States v. Stevens , 224 F.2d 866 (3rd Cir. 1955).
( See Sokol, The Availability of Transcripts for Federal Prisoners, 2 Am.Crim.L.Q.
63 (1964), which traces the history of section 753(f) .)
Notably, however, the 2255 provision, unlike the habeas corpus provision, requires certification by the trial judge or a circuit judge that the suit or appeal is not frivolous and that the transcript is needed to decide the issue presented by the suit or appeal.
4 At the time that this certification requirement was codified, it probably was an accurate reflection of Supreme Court case law.
See Benthiem v. United States , 403 F.2d at 1011 .
The requirement that the judge certify that the suit or appeal was nonfrivolous was hardly more than a requirement that he state affirmatively what he necessarily held by implication when he granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis.
After Coppedge v. United States , 369 U.S. 438 , 82 S.Ct. 917 , 88 L.Ed.2d 21 (1962), anyone allowed to proceed in forma pauperis can be presumed to have asserted nonfrivolous grounds.
The second requirement--that the judge certify that the transcript was needed to decide the issue tendered by the prisoner--was more significant, but probably rested on the line of Supreme Court cases which appeared to condition an indigent's right to a free transcript on a successful showing of need.
See Draper v. Washington , 372 U.S. at 496 , 83 S.Ct. 774 ; Lane v. Brown , 372 U.S. at 480 , 83 S.Ct. 768 ; Eskridge v. Washington State Board of Prison Terms & Paroles , 357 U.S. at 215-216 , 78 S.Ct. 1061 ; Griffin v. Illinois , 351 U.S. at 16 , 76 S.Ct. 585 .
In recent years, however, the requirement of a particularized showing of need has been severely undercut both by the march of events and by decisions of the Supreme Court.
In 1964, even before the sentence referring to the provision of free transcripts in 2255 proceedings was added to section 753(f) , four members of the Supreme Court advocated that full transcripts be provided in all federal criminal cases to indigent defendants who seek to prosecute an appeal.
Hardy v. United States , 375 U.S. at 282 , 84 S.Ct. 424 (concurring opinion).
In an opinion concurred in by three other justices, Mr. Justice Goldberg emphasized: 375 U.S. at 288 84 S.Ct. at 431 Five years later, in Gardner v. California , supra , which held that an indigent California habeas applicant was entitled to a transcript of a previous habeas hearing for use in preparing his second habeas petition, the Court did not require the petitioner to show specifically why and how he needed a full transcript.
A close reading of the opinion strongly suggests that the court's holding rests not on any assumption that some particular portion of the transcript might be essential to the second habeas application, but rather on the concession that adequate preparation requires a complete review of the transcript of all prior relevant proceedings.
Finally, in Britt v. North Carolina , supra , the Court expressly questioned the constitutional validity of requiring an indigent to make a showing of need before the transcript of a mistrial must be provided at state expense.
A majority of the Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Marshall, said: 404 U.S. at 228 92 S.Ct. at 434 The Court went on to observe that in Griffin v. Illinois , supra , it had been able to rely on a concession of need by the state, and, in subsequent cases, it had taken judicial notice of the importance of a transcript in a variety of circumstances.
The Court then cited Long v. District Court of Iowa , supra , and Roberts v. LaVallee , supra , as examples of cases in which it had "simply found it unnecessary to discuss the question *."
404 U.S. at 228 , n. 3, 92 S.Ct. at 434 .
Thus, the clear trend of recent cases- Hardy , Gardner and Britt --has been away from the requirement that, before an indigent can obtain a free transcript of prior proceedings, he must make a showing of need tailored to the facts of a particular case. For us to rest the denial to MacCollom of a trial transcript on the ground that he failed to specify precisely why he needed it would be to revive a rule rapidly losing favor before the Supreme Court.
In rebuttal, the government contends that the three Supreme Court opinions allegedly discounting the need for a preliminary showing of need are all distinguishable from this case: Hardy involved a direct appeal; Gardner , the equivalent of an appeal from a prior denial of a petition for habeas corpus ( see Hoover v. United States , 416 F.2d 431, 432 (6th Cir. 1969)), and Britt , a prior mistrial.
Unlike the transcripts at issue in these cases, the government continues, a transcript of MacCollom's original trial would be of relatively little value to him at this time.
Quoting from the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in United States v. Shoaf , supra , the government argues: 341 F.2d at 835 Assuming that the "usual" grounds for collateral relief do involve either events outside the courtroom or events inside the courtroom which some defendants might recall without the aid of a transcript--and we are aware of no empirical study to support this assumption 5 --we have no reason to know whether a particular transcript would contain a basis for collateral attack, not obvious to a layman with even a good memory.
No one has seen MacCollom's trial transcript, and some statistical probability concerning the content of most trial transcripts seems a poor reason to deny MacCollom access to his own.
The Fourth Circuit rule requires an imprisoned indigent to remember constitutional deficiencies and to relate them to an attorney or directly to the court, neither of whom may have had any previous contact with the prisoner or his trial, with sufficient clarity and accuracy to establish a particularized need for part or all of his trial transcript.
Meanwhile, his wealthy cellmate is permitted to purchase a trial transcript and hire an attorney to peruse it at his leisure in search of ground for collateral relief.
The Fourth Circuit has said that an indigent is not entitled to a transcript at government expense "merely to comb the record in the hope of discovering some flaw."
United States v. Glass , 317 F.2d at 202 .
However, we do not read the Supreme Court's opinions nor the Constitution itself to require paupers to have better memories than the affluent.
See Bentley v. United States , 431 F.2d at 253 .
6 The principle established by Griffin and its progeny does not guarantee indigents the same treatment afforded wealthy defendants; rather, it is only necessary that they be given equivalent and fundamentally fair treatment.
See Kamisar & Choper, The Right to Counsel in Minnesota: Some Field Findings and Legal Policy Observations, 48 Minn.L.Rev.
1, 10 (1963).
7 In Ross v. Moffitt , 417 U.S. 600 , 94 S.Ct. 2437 , 41 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974), the Supreme Court held that neither the due-process clause nor the equal-protection clause requires a state to provide an indigent with counsel either on his discretionary appeal to the state supreme court or on his petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court.
However, the Court also observed that the equal-protection clause requires that "indigents have an adequate opportunity to present their claims fairly within the adversarial system."
417 U.S. at 612 , 94 S.Ct. at 2444-2445 .
A rule which demands that an indigent establish his need for a trial transcript, which he has never seen, before the government will produce it for his assistance in preparing a post-conviction motion under 28 U.S.C. 2255 may completely deny the indigent the opportunity to present a valid claim which he was not fortunate enough to remember.
This rule seems to us to be a short-sighted approach that elevates economy over equality.
The increased cost to the government of providing free transcripts to all imprisoned indigents for use in preparing 2255 motions should not be overestimated.
Title 28 U.S.C. 753(b) already requires that a verbatim record be kept of all proceedings in open federal court.
Those indigents who have appealed their convictions routinely obtain complete or relatively complete trial transcripts for use on appeal.
Since Hardy v. United States , supra , decided in 1964, where a new counsel has been appointed for the appeal, he has been able to obtain a full transcript.
Even where the trial lawyer is also appointed for the appeal, in some districts he is able to obtain a full transcript as a matter of form.
See Note, The Indigent's Right to a Transcript of Record, 20 Kan.L.Rev.
766 n. 135.
In this circuit, except in very rare cases, a full trial transcript is prepared for any appellant who requests one, whether or not his retained or appointed trial attorney continues to serve him for the appeal.
Also, since most criminal defendants plead guilty rather than are found guilty after trial, 8 the cost of many of the requested transcripts will be minimal.
Finally, of the relatively few federal prisoners who have not already obtained a trial transcript, many or even most will have no wish to file a motion to vacate sentence and, hence, will not even seek a transcript.
Even more to the fiscal point is the cost of litigating transcript questions.
In Hardy v. United States the government conceded that in one district requests for transcripts for use on appeal were not even opposed where the cost of the transcript would not exceed $200.00.
The United States Attorney observed that in these cases the cost of opposing the motion would exceed the cost of preparing the transcript.
375 U.S. at 279 , n. 1, 84 S.Ct. 424 .
See also Hardy v. United States , 375 U.S. at 289-292 , 84 S.Ct. 424 (concurring opinion of Goldberg, J.).
The present statutory scheme requires prisoners and their attorneys to assert 2255 claims in the hope that they will be supported by the transcript once it has been prepared.
If a free transcript were prepared on demand, the transcript may well reveal no colorable grounds for collateral attack, and the court will be spared the time consumed in a transcript hearing and a frivolous 2255 motion.
See generally Jacob & Sharma, Justice after Trial: Prisoners' Need for Legal Services in the Criminal-Correctional Process, 18 Kan.L.Rev.
493, 496-497, 509 (1970).
Thus, having surveyed many of the costs associated with the present system of requiring a court to certify that a particular portion of the record is needed to decide a specific point raised by a 2255 motion, we are far from convinced that a rule entitling an indigent prisoner to a free transcript upon request would greatly increase the overall cost to the federal judicial system.
However, even if we concede that there will be a net increase in cost, there is good authority for looking beyond the dollar sign: "An affluent society ought not be miserly in support of justice, for economy is not an objective of the system *."
Mayer v. City of Chicago , 404 U.S. at 201 , 92 S.Ct. at 418 (concurring opinion of Burger, C. J.).
See also Mayer v. City of Chicago , 404 U.S. at 196-197 , 92 S.Ct. 410 .
We hold then that an indigent federal prisoner, 9 permitted to proceed in forma pauperis, who has not yet obtained a transcript of his criminal trial, is entitled to such a transcript, upon request, in order to assist him in the preparation of a postconviction motion under 28 U.S.C. 2255 .
Reversed and remanded.
