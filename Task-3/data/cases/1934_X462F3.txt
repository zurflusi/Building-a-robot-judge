 DAVIS , Circuit Judge.
The facts in this case are substantially like those in the case of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. John G. Williams et al.
(C. C. A.) 72 F.(2d) 509 , in which an opinion has just been filed.
The same issues are involved in this case as were in that.
Consequently, on the authority of that case, the decree of the District Court is affirmed.
