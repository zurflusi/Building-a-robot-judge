 LAY , Circuit Judge.
The Supreme Court has remanded our decision, 586 F.2d 1230 (8th Cir. 1978), for us to reconsider in light of its recent opinion in Hughes v. Oklahoma , U.S. , 99 S.Ct. 1727 , 60 L.Ed.2d 250 (1979).
Upon review, we discern significant differences between the cases which cause us to adhere to our earlier holding that the Commerce Clause, Art.
I, 8 , cl.
3 of the United States Constitution, is not violated by the State of South Dakota's policy of preferential sale of cement it manufactures to South Dakota residents.
In Hughes v. Oklahoma the Supreme Court overruled Geer v. Connecticut , 161 U.S. 519 , 16 S.Ct. 600 , 40 L.Ed. 793 (1896).
The Court rejected the legal fiction that a state owns wild game as a representative of its citizens and the correlative theory that it could control not only the taking of game, but also its transportation out-of-state even after it was lawfully possessed by another, thereby preventing it from becoming an item of interstate commerce.
99 S.Ct. at 1731-33 .
Thus, the well established doctrine that a state may not discriminatorily regulate interstate commerce by giving its residents preferred access over out-of-state residents to local natural resources, see, e. g. , City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey , 437 U.S. 617 , 98 S.Ct. 2531 , 57 L.Ed.2d 475 (1978); Pennsylvania v. West Virginia , 262 U.S. 553 , 43 S.Ct. 658 , 67 L.Ed. 1117 (1923); West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co. , 221 U.S. 229 , 31 S.Ct. 564 , 55 L.Ed. 716 (1911), now applies as well to wild game.
Our original decision in Reeves v. Kelley , 586 F.2d 1230 (8th Cir. 1978), which upheld South Dakota's preference for instate residents in its sale of cement, was not based on the rationale that the cement was a state controlled natural resource and therefore South Dakota could regulate or prohibit its trade in interstate commerce.
Reeves v. Kelley presented the unusual situation in which the challenge was to a state, which as a manufacturer-seller faced with production demands it could not meet, made an administrative decision to give priority to meeting the needs of its residents.
As our opinion pointed out, there was no allegation that South Dakota regulated or restricted out-of-state sale of privately manufactured cement or exercised its police powers to suppress competition in the manufacture or sale of cement.
We held that South Dakota was acting in a proprietary capacity in the sale of a product it manufactured and that as such it had the right, as any other entrepreneur, to sell to whomever it chose.
1 The issue remains whether the decision in Hughes v. Oklahoma affects our prior holding.
In both Hughes v. Oklahoma and Geer v. Connecticut , the state restricted out-of-state sale of wildlife reduced to possession and ownership by private individuals.
In contrast South Dakota has not attempted "to prevent privately owned articles of trade from being shipped and sold in interstate commerce .
. "
City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey , 437 U.S. 617, 627 , 98 S.Ct. 2531, 2537 , 57 L.Ed.2d 475 (1978), (quoting Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel , 278 U.S. 1, 10 , 49 S.Ct. 1 , 73 L.Ed. 147 (1928)).
In entering the market and preferring residents in sales, South Dakota has not attempted to regulate commerce; it has not attempted to interfere with or usurp federal regulatory power.
2 While out-of-state purchasers such as Reeves may feel the effect of a reduced supply of cement in the interstate market, the effect is the result of a major supplier's temporary marketing decision, not unlike the market force exerted by Maryland's purchasing policies in Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp. , 426 U.S. 794 , 96 S.Ct. 2488 , 49 L.Ed.2d 220 (1976).
South Dakota has not sought to regulate interstate commerce in the sale of cement.
We conclude that its action is more similar to Maryland's preference for its residents in its entry into the automobile scrap processing market, upheld in Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp. , than conduct at which the prohibitions of the Commerce Clause have historically been directed.
3 We therefore abide by our previous holding that the Commerce Clause does not prohibit South Dakota "from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others."
Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp. , 426 U.S. at 810 , 96 S.Ct. at 2498 .
