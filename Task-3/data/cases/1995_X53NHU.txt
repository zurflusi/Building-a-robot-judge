 RONEY , Senior Circuit Judge: On appeal by the Government in this estate tax case, we affirm the United States Tax Court holding that the marital and charitable deductions are to be reduced only by the portion of administration expenses allocated to principal and not by amounts allocated to income.
Estate of Otis C. Hubert v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue , 101 T.C. 314 , 1993 WL 414716 (1993).
This holding brings us in conflict with the two other circuits which have decided the issue.
Estate of Street v. Commissioner , 974 F.2d 723 (6th Cir.1992); Burke v. United States , 994 F.2d 1576 (Fed.Cir.
), cert. denied , U.S. , 114 S.Ct. 546 , 126 L.Ed.2d 448 (1993).
The Tax Court, in a reviewed decision, concurred in by 15 of the 17 Tax Court judges, specifically declined to accept the reasoning in Street in a comprehensive opinion.
Since the Tax Court wrote a careful analysis of every argument that is made by the Commissioner on this appeal, and we agree with the reasoning in that opinion, we simply attach that part of the opinion found at 101 T.C. at 320-30 as an Appendix and adopt it as our own, as completely as if we had set it forth herein.
We note just four points that may assist in understanding the analysis made in the portion of the Tax Court opinion attached.
First , the Tax Court was confronted with other issues not raised on this appeal so that the portion attached deals only with the issue on this appeal.
Critical to understanding that opinion, however, is the following footnote on page 2 of the original opinion: 101 T.C. at 350 Second , this case involves the $30,000,000 estate of Otis C. Hubert, a Georgia resident.
There was considerable other litigation in connection with the estate.
The settlement agreement referred to in the portion of the opinion published here was the result of some prior litigation.
Third , Georgia law authorizes allocation of expenses to income rather than principal, if the will so provides.
Ga.Code Ann. 53-2-101 , 53-15-3 (Michie 1982).
Hubert's will authorized such an allocation.
See Estate of Warren v. Commissioner , 981 F.2d 776 (5th Cir.1993) (allocation of administrative expenses to income allowed by state law did not reduce the charitable deduction).
Fourth , the estate included a generous amount of income producing property.
From 1986 until 1991, the estate generated over $4,500,000 of income and incurred over $2,000,000 in administration expenses.
The executors allocated $506,989 to the principal of the estate and paid the rest of the administration expenses from post-death income and deducted it on the estate's income tax returns.
Our reasons for disagreeing with the Sixth Circuit's analysis in Street are the same as those which addressed that case in the Tax Court opinion.
The later decided case of Burke by the Federal Circuit simply relied on Street and added nothing new to the discussion.
1 AFFIRMED.
