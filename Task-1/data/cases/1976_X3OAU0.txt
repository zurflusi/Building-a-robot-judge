 EDWARDS , Circuit Judge.
The United States appeals from dismissal without trial of a criminal indictment against defendant Adamo Wrecking Company.
The first issue presented by this case is whether or not either the District Court or this court had or has jurisdiction to review an "emission standard" adopted as a regulation under the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 1857 (1970).
The second issue (if it is reached) is whether or not 40 C.F.R. 61.22 (1975), which is quoted below, is or is not "an emission standard" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 1857c-7 (1970): 61.22 40 C.F.R. 61.22(d)(2)(i)(1975) The importance of the emission standard question becomes obvious when we consider three provisions of the Clean Air Act.
The first provision makes any violation of an emission standard a criminal act.
See Section 113 ( 42 U.S.C. 1857c-8(c) ).
The second provides: Section 112(c)(1) 42 U.S.C. 1857c-7(c)(1)(b) The third provision provides for petitions for "review of action of the Administrator in promulgating" any emission standard under " 1857c-7 " to be "filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia" within specified time limits, and flatly prohibits "judicial review in .
.
.
criminal proceedings for enforcement."
Section 307(b) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b) (1970), provides in full: A petition for review of action of the Administrator in promulgating any emission standard under section 1857c-7 of this title section 1857c-6 section 1857f-1 section 1857f-1(b) section 1857f-1(b) section 1857f-6c section 1857f-9 may be filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia section 1857c-6(d) section 1857c-10(c) (2) Action of the Administrator with respect to which review could have been obtained under paragraph (1) shall not be subject to judicial review in civil or criminal proceedings for enforcement We must consider still another portion of this record before we can turn toward a reasoned decision.
The dismissed first count 1 of the indictment read: Section 1857c-7(c) 38 F.R.
8829 40 C.F.R. 61.22(d)(2)(i) Appellee phrases the appellate question in this case as follows: Plainly, however, the indictment does charge that defendant Adamo "did knowingly cause the emission of asbestos" by failing to wet friable asbestos before demolition.
Hence appellee's question only makes sense when its brief explains that it does not consider the regulation, 40 C.F.R. 61.22 to be "an emission standard" within the meaning of the Act.
And, indeed, the District Judge found that 40 C.F.R. 61.22 was not an emission standard.
Before turning to his reasons for taking that point of view, however, we note that preliminary thereto he rejected appellee's argument that the indictment was facially defective in failing to charge an essential element: Rudin v. U. S. 254 F.2d 45, 48 357 U.S. 930 78 S.Ct. 1374 2 L.Ed.2d 1371 But it is not necessary that the indictment follow the exact wording of the statute Glenn v. U. S. 303 F.2d 536, 538 372 U.S. 920 83 S.Ct. 734 9 L.Ed.2d 725 Rudin supra, at 48 Wright, supra 125 U. S. v. Berlin Richman and Denmon supra United States v. Berlin 472 F.2d 1002 United States v. Richman 369 F.2d 465 United States v. Denmon 483 F.2d 1093 cause the emission of asbestos by failing to wet and remove firable [sic] [friable] before demolition had begun by Russell supra Russell v. United States 369 U.S. 749 82 S.Ct. 1038 8 L.Ed.2d 240 U. S. v. Marra 481 F.2d 1196 9 9 U. S. v. Nat.
Wrecking Co. 74 CR 755 U. S. v. Nardi Wrecking Co. 74 CR 756 U. S. v. Harvey Wrecking Co. 74 CR 758 U. S. v. Brandenberg Demolition Co. 74 CR 757 We agree with this reasoning and adopt it for the purposes of this appeal.
The District Judge next turned to consideration of the government's claim that Section 307(b) of the Act ( 42 U.S.C. 1857h-5 ) deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to entertain the present attack upon the regulation.
Finding in Section 307(b) an ambiguity which he resolved in favor of jurisdiction, the District Judge proceeded to examine the regulation and to hold it invalid.
We disagree with the District Judge's conclusion as to jurisdiction and hence we have no need to deal with validity of the emission standard.
The District Judge reasoned that the word "promulgating" may be read as applying more to procedure than to substance and hence that the prohibition on review of an emission standard under Section 307(b)(2) does not prohibit an attack on the validity of the standard as opposed to an attack upon the procedures by which it was enacted.
The construction adopted by the District Judge appears to us to raise more questions than it answers.
If review of the substance of national emission standards is not provided for in 307(b)(1) where is it provided for?
Would Congress have intended to leave review of the validity of a national emission standard to District Court enforcement proceedings in fifty states with the high probability of many conflicting interpretations?
Why would Congress ban review of procedure in District Court enforcement proceedings and allow District Court review of substance when clearly the latter is more likely to occasion a greater diversity of District Court opinions and a consequent greater confusion concerning the meaning of the standard and its enforcement?
We find no satisfactory answer to these questions under the District Judge's interpretation.
On the other hand, we believe that the language "action of the Administrator in promulgating" can more readily be taken to apply to both the procedures by which it was adopted and the substance of the regulation.
This clearly is the view taken of the matter by the D. C. Circuit in Oljato Chapter of Navajo Tribe v. Train , 169 U.S.App.D.C.
195 , 515 F.2d 654 (1975), where that court rejected a distinction between agency action and the standard itself and held that an attack upon the standard itself "can be brought only in this court under Section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act.

The United States Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit also said: Functional Music Functional Music, Inc. v. FCC 107 U.S.App.D.C.

45(c) 16 U.S.C. 825 l 49 U.S.C. 1486(a) Oljato Chapter of Navajo Tribe v. Train supra at 659 Two other Circuits have also specifically applied the exclusive review provision of 307(b)(2)--albeit not in the setting of a criminal case: Getty Oil Company (Eastern Operations), Inc. v. Ruckelshaus , 467 F.2d 349 (3d Cir. 1972), cert. denied , 409 U.S. 1125 , 93 S.Ct. 937 , 35 L.Ed.2d 256 (1973); Union Electric Co. v. Environmental Protection Agency , 515 F.2d 206, 220 (8th Cir. 1975), aff'd 427 U.S. 246 , 96 S.Ct. 2518 , 49 L.Ed.2d 474 (1976).
See also City of Highland Park v. Train , 519 F.2d 681 (7th Cir. 1975), cert. denied , 424 U.S. 927 , 96 S.Ct. 1141 , 47 L.Ed.2d 337 (1976).
More important still, the United States Supreme Court long ago upheld the exact sort of exclusivity in review here involved, although in the context of another regulatory act.
In Yakus v. United States , 321 U.S. 414 , 64 S.Ct. 660 , 88 L.Ed. 834 (1944), the Court said: Douglas v. City of Jeannette 319 U.S. 157, 163 63 S.Ct. 877, 881, 882 87 L.Ed. 1324 Bradley v. Richmond supra 227 U.S. 477 33 S.Ct. 318 57 L.Ed. 603 Wadley Southern Ry. Co. v. Georgia supra 235 U.S. [651 35 S.Ct. [214 59 L.Ed. 405 Yakus v. United States supra, at 443-44 64 S.Ct. at 676 It should be noted that Yakus , like our instant appeal, was decided in the context of a criminal prosecution and involved an exclusive right of review statute.
By its terms it is obvious that the Administrator issued the disputed regulation under 112(b) of the Act.
See 36 Fed.Reg.
23239 (1971); 38 Fed.Reg.
8820 (1973).
Section 112(b) deals only with "National emission standards."
Further, the disputed regulation is entitled an "emission standard."
2 We do not believe that there is anything vague, ambiguous, or difficult to interpret in the prohibition of Section 307(b) : section 1857c-7 Section 307(b) 42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b) Its intent could hardly be more obvious.
Legislative history of the Clean Air Act supports the interpretation of Section 307(b) which we have set out above.
The question of judicial review was considered only in the Senate.
The Senate Report, S.Rep.No.91-1196, 91st Cong., 2d.
Sess., 40-42 (1970), noted that review of emission standards was placed in the D. C. Circuit to assure "even and consistent national application" of the standards.
The 30-day time limit for review was established "to maintain the integrity of the time sequences provided throughout the Act.

As we see this record, there is no doubt that appellant could have challenged the standard through the procedure outlined in Section 307(b)(1) had it chosen to do so.
We recognize, of course, that appellee relies strongly upon four District Court cases from the Northern District of Illinois: United States v. National Wrecking Co. , No. 74 CR 755 (N.D.Ill., Dec. 20, 1974); United States v. Nardi Wrecking Co. No. 74 CR 756 (N.D.Ill., Jan. 2, 1975); United States v. Harvey Wrecking Co. , No. 74 CR 758 (N.D.Ill., Jan. 7, 1975); United States v. Brandenburg Demolition, Inc. , No. 74 CR 757 (N.D.Ill., Jan. 31, 1975).
Although some of these cases contain dicta which support the appellee's point of view on the jurisdiction issue, the decisions were actually based upon failure of the indictments to charge emission of a prohibited pollutant.
As noted above, the indictment in our instant case clearly did charge such an emission; and we find the dicta unpersuasive.
Leedom v. Kyne , 358 U.S. 184 , 79 S.Ct. 180 , 3 L.Ed.2d 210 (1958), relied upon by the appellee is, we believe, inapposite.
There was no similar prompt, exclusive review procedure provided in that case; and the facts showed that the NLRB "attempted [an] exercise of power that had been specifically withheld."
Leedom v. Kyne , supra at 189 , 79 S.Ct. at 184 .
As to Manges v. Camp , 474 F.2d 97 (5th Cir. 1973), we consider it distinguishable on its facts and unpersuasive in any possible application to this appeal.
We do not find in this record any "clear departure from statutory authority."
Manges v. Camp , supra at 99 .
No constitutional issues were decided by the District Judge or are properly before us in this appeal.
Under what we have said above, we hold that the District Judge was in error in finding that he had jurisdiction to determine the validity of the disputed asbestos emission regulation and in dismissing the indictment.
The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.
