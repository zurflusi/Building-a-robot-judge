 PREGERSON , Circuit Judge: Defendants-Appellants Samuel A. Lewis, Director of the Arizona Department of Corrections, et al., appeal the district court's order finding that Plaintiffs-Appellees Fletcher Casey Jr., et al., prisoners incarcerated in facilities of the Arizona Department of Corrections, were unconstitutionally denied meaningful access to the courts.
Defendants also appeal the district court's issuance of a permanent injunction requiring the Arizona Department of Corrections to implement a plan to ensure prisoners meaningful access to the courts.
We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1291 and 1292(a)(1) .
We AFFIRM in part, and VACATE and REMAND in part.
1 BACKGROUND The Arizona Department of Corrections ("ADOC") operates nine prison facilities located within the State of Arizona.
The total male inmate population as of January 22, 1992 was 14,424 and the total female inmate population was 922.
On January 12, 1990, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983 , twenty-two prisoners filed this class action in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, claiming, inter alia , 2 that prison officials unconstitutionally denied them meaningful access to the courts.
The certified class consists of all adult persons who are now, or who will be, in the custody of the Arizona Department of Corrections.
Defendants are agents, officials, or employees of ADOC.
On November 16, 1992, following a three-month bench trial, U.S. District Judge C.A. Muecke ruled that ADOC's law libraries and legal assistance programs were inadequate, unconstitutionally denying prisoners meaningful access to the courts.
Casey v. Lewis , 834 F.Supp.
1553 (D.Ariz.1992).
Specifically, Judge Muecke found the following constitutionally deficient: the contents of the library; the access to the libraries; the legal assistance for prisoners who are illiterate or who do not speak English; library staffing; the indigency standard for receiving legal supplies; the photocopying policy that allowed the confidentiality of legal documents to be breached; and the restrictions on inmates' telephone calls to their attorneys.
Id. The district court appointed Dan Pachoda as Special Master and Expert, and Janet Bliss as Assistant Special Master to work with the parties to develop the proper injunctive relief.
On October 13, 1993, the district court issued a permanent injunction, requiring ADOC to implement the legal access plan devised by Pachoda.
ADOC now appeals, challenging the district court's findings of fact and conclusions of law, the scope of injunctive relief ordered, and the requirement that ADOC pay the fees of the Special Master without having been given an opportunity to object.
ANALYSIS A. Standard of Review We review the district court's legal conclusions de novo.
U.S. v. Yacoubian , 24 F.3d 1, 3 (9th Cir.1994).
We defer to the district court's findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.
Anderson v. City of Bessemer , 470 U.S. 564, 571-73 , 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1510-11 , 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985); Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) .
We review the scope of injunctive relief for an abuse of discretion or application of erroneous legal principles.
Dexter v. Kirschner , 984 F.2d 979, 982 (9th Cir.1992).
B. District Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law In Bounds v. Smith , 430 U.S. 817, 823 , 97 S.Ct. 1491, 1495 , 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977), the Supreme Court firmly established that prisoners have a fundamental right of meaningful access to the courts.
The importance of this right cannot be overstated.
It is the right upon which all other rights depend.
In Wolff v. McDonnell , 418 U.S. 539, 579 , 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2986 , 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), the Court explained that this right "is founded in the Due Process Clause and assures that no person will be denied the opportunity to present to the judiciary allegations concerning violations of fundamental constitutional rights."
See also Gilmore v. Lynch , 319 F.Supp.
105, 110 (N.D.Cal.1970) ("'Access to the courts' encompasses all the means a defendant might require to get a fair hearing from the judiciary on all charges brought against him or grievances alleged by him.
"), aff'd sub nom.
Younger v. Gilmore , 404 U.S. 15 , 92 S.Ct. 250 , 30 L.Ed.2d 142 (1971) (per curiam).
To discharge the duty of assuring prisoners meaningful access to the courts, the Court held that States "must assist inmates in the preparation and filing of meaningful papers by providing prisoners with adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from persons trained in the law."
Bounds 430 U.S. at 828 , 97 S.Ct. at 1498 .
In determining the constitutional adequacy of a legal access program, the Court directed district courts to evaluate the program "as a whole," emphasizing that "meaningful access to the courts is the touchstone."
Id. at 832, 823 , 97 S.Ct. at 1500, 1495 .
We hold that the district court correctly applied case law in concluding that ADOC's legal access program unconstitutionally denied inmates meaningful access to the courts.
In Storseth v. Spellman , 654 F.2d 1349, 1352 (9th Cir.1981), we held that it is the State's burden to provide meaningful access and to demonstrate that its chosen method is adequate.
ADOC has not met this burden.
1.
Contents of the Law Libraries Undisputed facts support the district court's finding that the contents of ADOC's law libraries are inadequate.
In several libraries, volumes of various reporters, as well as the pocket parts to various secondary sources are missing.
Updated inventories are unquestionably an essential element of an adequate library system.
See Lindquist v. Idaho State Board of Corrections , 776 F.2d 851 (9th Cir.1985) (affirming district court's order that state must furnish essential and up-to-date law books).
Several libraries also do not contain self-help manuals to instruct inmates on how to use the law books.
The complexities of legal research at the very least require these aids to enable inmates to use the books effectively.
As the Court in Bounds mandated, access must be "adequate, effective , and meaningful."
430 U.S. at 822 , 97 S.Ct. at 1495 (emphasis added).
2.
Physical Access We recognized in Lindquist that the Constitution does not guarantee a prisoner unlimited access to a law library, and that "[p]rison officials of necessity must regulate the time, manner, and place in which library facilities are used."
776 F.2d at 858 .
Accordingly, in Toussaint v. McCarthy , 801 F.2d 1080, 1109 (9th Cir.1986), cert. denied , 481 U.S. 1069 , 107 S.Ct. 2462 , 95 L.Ed.2d 871 (1987), we held that prisons may deny inmates physical access to the law library if such access would threaten institutional security.
We affirmed the district court's order that required prison officials to allow segregated prisoners access to a law library "as reasonably necessary, absent documented security reasons."
Id. at 1108-09 .
Following the rule established in Toussaint , we hold that unless ADOC can demonstrate actual security risks, an inmate should be allowed access to the law library.
The district court correctly concluded that ADOC may not routinely prohibit lockdown inmates from physically using the law library.
3 Access to the law library's books is crucial because as we explained in Toussaint , 801 F.2d at 1110 (quoting Williams v. Leeke , 584 F.2d 1336, 1339 (4th Cir.1978), cert. denied , 442 U.S. 911 , 99 S.Ct. 2825 , 61 L.Ed.2d 276 (1979)).
3.
Legal Assistance For those inmates deemed security risks and denied access to the library, Bounds requires the State to provide legal assistance.
430 U.S. at 828 , 97 S.Ct. at 1498 .
The district court did not err in concluding that the legal assistance provided by ADOC was constitutionally deficient.
In some facilities, officials do not require inmate applicants to possess any qualifications aside from a literacy in English.
In others, the tests developed to assess the applicants' qualifications do not test for skills in legal research and writing, nor do the officials administer the tests to all of the applicants.
Furthermore, in most facilities, the officials do not provide any type of training for the legal assistants.
This deficiency directly contravenes the rule set forth in Bounds that legal assistance must be provided by persons "trained in the law."
Id. See also Gluth v. Kangas , 951 F.2d 1504, 1508 (9th Cir.1991) ("the appearance of minimal capacity to assist other inmates alone plainly does not suffice").
Sufficient numbers of trained legal assistants also must be provided to prisoners who are functionally illiterate or whose primary language is not English.
It goes without saying that "a book and a library are of no use, in and of themselves, to a prisoner who cannot read."
Lindquist , 776 F.2d at 855-56 .
ADOC's failure to provide bilingual legal assistants or law clerks in many of the facilities denies non-English-speaking inmates meaningful access.
The reliance upon fellow prisoners who are not trained in the law simply does not suffice as an adequate substitute.
As the district court found, these fellow prisoners frequently cannot comprehend nor translate legal terminology.
Consequently, illiterate and non-English-speaking inmates have been unable to file legal actions or have had their cases dismissed with prejudice.
To be sure, we have held that "the Constitution does not require the elimination of all economic, intellectual, and technological barriers to litigation."
Sands v. Lewis , 886 F.2d 1166, 1169 (9th Cir.1989).
However, in invalidating regulations that barred prisoners from assisting each other, the Supreme Court recognized that for illiterate inmates, an adequate library alone was plainly insufficient.
Johnson v. Avery , 393 U.S. 483, 489 , 89 S.Ct. 747, 750 , 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969); Wolff v. McDonnell , 418 U.S. at 577-80 , 94 S.Ct. at 2985-87 .
4 The duty of States to furnish legal assistance to illiterate inmates and non-English-speaking inmates is implicit in the holding of Bounds , which imposed on States " affirmative obligations to assure all prisoners meaningful access to the courts."
430 U.S. at 824 , 97 S.Ct. at 1496 (emphasis added).
Without such assistance, illiterate and non-English-speaking inmates undoubtedly would be unable to draft any legal papers, much less meaningful ones.
5 As the Sixth Circuit observed, "there can be no meaningful access to the judicial system unless some literate person is available to reduce [the] stories [of illiterate inmates] to intelligible written pleadings."
Knop v. Johnson , 977 F.2d 996, 1006 (6th Cir.1992), cert. denied , U.S. , 113 S.Ct. 1415 , 122 L.Ed.2d 786 (1993).
Importantly, the Bounds Court noted the advantages of providing legal assistance over libraries alone: more efficient and skillful handling of prisoner cases, the avoidance of disciplinary problems associated with writ writers, and the mediation of many prisoner complaints that would otherwise burden the courts.
6 430 U.S. at 831-32 , 97 S.Ct. at 1499-1500 .
ADOC argues that it does not need to provide legal assistance to illiterate and non-English-speaking prisoners because through the provision of a law library, it has removed "the barriers to court access erected by imprisonment."
Appellants' Brief at 23.
This argument is without merit because ADOC overlooks the fact that the restrictions on a prisoner's liberty attendant to imprisonment prevents the prisoner from enlisting the assistance of his family, friends, and a myriad of social services and legal aid organizations that would otherwise be available.
4.
Library Staff In Lindquist , 776 F.2d at 855 , we noted that to furnish an adequate law library, "some library personnel might be required to keep the books in order."
In some facilities, ADOC staffs the library only with security officers who are not trained in maintaining a law library.
We affirm the district court's conclusion that this is inadequate.
Library staff should at least have some basic knowledge of legal research.
5.
Indigency Standard Bounds affirmed the principle that "indigent inmates must be provided at state expense with paper and pen to draft legal documents, with notarial services to authenticate them, and with stamps to mail them."
430 U.S. at 824-25 , 97 S.Ct. at 1496 .
ADOC's indigency policy allows a prisoner to obtain free legal supplies only if his account balance does not exceed $22 per month.
The prisoner's account is then debited the cost of the supplies, and the debit is held against the account until funds become available.
Defendants argue that the prisoners here have failed to allege an actual injury in a non-core Bounds issue, as required under Sands v. Lewis , 886 F.2d 1166, 1171 (9th Cir.1989).
In Sands , we held that if the claimant does not allege inadequate law libraries or inadequate legal assistance, a court must consider whether the allegation consists of a "specific instance in which an inmate was actually denied access to the courts."
Id. Although Plaintiff's Complaint did not allege that ADOC's indigency standard denied inmates meaningful access to the courts, Plaintiffs did introduce, without any objection from Defendants, evidence to show that the indigency standard was inadequate.
See Transcript at 136 (McFadden--Direct) (testimony that the cost of basic supplies alone can amount to $20); Transcript at 154 (Bishop--Direct) (testimony that prisoners were unable to purchase needed legal supplies under the $22 standard).
In addition, the adequacy of the indigency standard was addressed in Defendants' pre-trial memorandum.
See Defendants' Amended Pre-Trial Statement at 15.
Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b) , "when issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings."
Express consent may be found in a stipulation or pretrial order, and implied consent may be found where evidence is introduced without objection.
See Dunn v. Trans World Airlines, Inc. , 589 F.2d 408, 413 (9th Cir.1978) (Rule 15(b) amendment proper since opposing party referred to unpleaded matter in its trial memorandum); Slavitt v. Kauhi , 384 F.2d 530, 534 (9th Cir.1967) (district court should grant leave to amend because issue was introduced into evidence without objection from defendant); 3 Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 15.11 (1994).
Instead of permitting Plaintiffs to amend their pleadings to include an allegation that ADOC's indigency standard deprived indigent inmates meaningful access to the courts, we will treat the pleadings as having been so amended because under Rule 15(b) , "the failure to amend does not affect the result of the trial."
See also Dunn , 589 F.2d at 413 ("If an amendment to the pleadings to conform to the proof should have been made, the Courts of Appeals will presume that it is so made to support the judgment.")
(citations omitted).
A study of the actual cost of basic supplies and legal supplies at the Florence unit determined that $46 is the more realistic amount.
Gluth , 951 F.2d at 1508 .
However, because the district court did not make a specific finding that ADOC's indigency standard was inadequate for this plaintiff class, we remand this issue for a proper finding.
6.
Photocopying Policy We reject Defendants' erroneous assertion that Plaintiffs have not alleged an "actual injury" as defined by Sands , supra , to state a claim that the photocopying policy breaches the confidentiality of inmates' legal documents.
Plaintiffs' Complaint specifically alleges that their confidential legal memos from legal assistants are routinely read by ADOC staff and that because they must give their materials to the staff to be photocopied, the confidentiality of those materials is compromised.
Complaint at 14.
Read liberally, as required by our decisions, these allegations suffice to state a claim for the denial of meaningful access to the courts.
See King v. Atiyeh , 814 F.2d 565, 568 (9th Cir.1987) (plaintiffs successfully alleged that the provision of only three stamps per week denied them meaningful access to the courts even though complaint only stated that it was often necessary to communicate with the courts more than three times per week).
The district court found that inmates' legal documents have been read by staff members who photocopy them.
In Wolff v. McDonnell , 418 U.S. at 575-77 , 94 S.Ct. at 2984-85 , the Court upheld a prison regulation that allowed staff to inspect, but not to read, inmates' legal mail.
Lower courts have held that legal mail may not be read nor copied without the permission of the inmate.
Jensen v. Klecker , 648 F.2d 1179, 1182 , (8th Cir.1981); Ramos v. Lamm , 639 F.2d 559, 582 (10th Cir.1980), cert. denied , 450 U.S. 1041 , 101 S.Ct. 1759 , 68 L.Ed.2d 239 (1981); Guajardo v. Estelle , 580 F.2d 748, 758-59 (5th Cir.1978).
Thus, the district court did not err in concluding that ADOC's photocopying policy, which allows the confidentiality of inmates' legal documents to be breached, denies inmates meaningful access to the courts.
7.
Telephone Calls to Attorneys In Ching v. Lewis , 895 F.2d 608, 609 (9th Cir.1990), we held that "policies will not be upheld if they unnecessarily abridge the defendant's meaningful access to his attorney and the courts," and that "the opportunity to communicate privately with an attorney is an important part of that meaningful access."
See also Procunier v. Martinez , 416 U.S. 396, 419 , 94 S.Ct. 1800, 1814 , 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974) ("Regulations and practices that unjustifiably obstruct the availability of professional representation are invalid.").
Because an inmate's access to his attorney is inextricably tied to his meaningful access to the courts, 7 we reject Defendant's argument that to state a claim, Plaintiffs need to allege an actual instance in which their access to the courts has been impeded.
The district court correctly concluded that the restrictions on attorney telephone calls interfere with inmates' meaningful access to the courts.
ADOC has not advanced any legitimate justification for its restrictions, such as the limitation of calls to issues related to a prisoner's sentence, the granting of calls according to institutional risk score as opposed to need, and the requirement that a prisoner divulge the nature of a call before it is granted.
C. Scope of Injunctive Relief Defendants challenge the breadth of the district court's permanent injunction, 8 arguing that it extends beyond the scope authorized by Bounds .
It is well established that "once a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of the district court's equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies."
Hutto v. Finney , 437 U.S. 678, 688 n. 9, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2572 n. 9, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1979) (citations omitted).
While the remedy must do no more and no less than correct a particular constitutional violation, Hoptowit v. Ray , 682 F.2d 1237, 1246-47 (9th Cir.1982), "a federal court may order relief that the Constitution would not of its own force initially require if such relief is necessary to remedy [that] violation."
Toussaint , 801 F.2d at 1087 .
See also Milliken v. Bradley , 433 U.S. 267 , 97 S.Ct. 2749 , 53 L.Ed.2d 745 ( Milliken II ) (1977) (upholding remedial educational programs to cure effects of de jure segregation even though such programs are not required under the Constitution).
We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the relief set forth in its permanent injunction.
At the outset, we must address what can only be characterized as the tension between the twin holdings of Bounds .
See Michael B. Mushlin, 2 Rights of Prisoners 35-41 (2d ed. 1993).
On the one hand, the mandate to States is to assure "meaningful access."
430 U.S. at 823 , 97 S.Ct. at 1495 .
But to discharge this duty, the Court prescribed "adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from persons trained in the law."
Id. at 828 , 97 S.Ct. at 1498 .
Some circuits, including our own, have interpreted Bounds only to require either adequate law libraries or adequate legal assistance.
See Lindquist , 776 F.2d at 855 .
Practically, though, because the great mass of prisoners are not sufficiently educated, such a legal access plan would still keep out of their reach meaningful access to the courts.
Accordingly, in Lindquist , we went on to say that even though states may choose which of the two components to provide, "this is not to say that a court may never order a mixture of [the two]."
Id. (quoting Cepulonis v. Fair , 732 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1984)).
Defendants appropriately remind us that a remedy may not overly intrude into the administration of the prison system.
Toussaint , 801 F.2d at 1087 .
Yet, the remedy ultimately must be "effective."
Id. at 1086 .
Given that 35 percent of ADOC's inmate population cannot read English above the seventh grade level, and 14.5 percent cannot speak English, it is unrealistic to expect that meaningful access to the courts can be achieved by providing law libraries alone.
The adequacy of any remedial program must turn on its effectiveness in satisfying the State's obligation to ensure meaningful access to the courts.
In fashioning an effective remedy, it is within the discretion of the district court to order a combination of remedial programs.
1.
Contents of Libraries The order requiring the purchase of the Pacific Reporters and Digests is reasonable.
As the district court noted, because some prisoners detained in ADOC facilities are serving time for crimes committed in a neighboring state, they will need the case law of that state, which is contained in the Pacific Reporters but not in the Arizona Reporters.
In addition, in shepardizing Arizona cases, the researcher is often referred to other cases decided in the western region of the United States, warranting the inclusion of the Pacific Reporters in the libraries' inventory.
2.
Physical Access The injunction orders ADOC to allow all inmates access to the law libraries absent a showing that the inmate is a security risk.
Defendants argue that under this order, an inmate must first cause harm before being denied access, thus precluding officials from taking preventive measures to maintain security.
We disagree.
The order seeks to prevent the arbitrary denial of access to the library, thus prison officials would be in compliance with the order if they can rationally justify a particular denial.
The order requiring the law libraries to remain open for at least fifty hours each week is reasonable.
Although ADOC subsequently expanded the hours of operation, the district court found that at the time this action was filed, prisoners had insufficient time to use the libraries.
See Lindquist , 776 F.2d at 858 ("the existence of an adequate law library does not provide for meaningful access to the courts if the inmates are not allowed a reasonable amount of time to use the library").
Given the finding of the district court, and that there is no "reasonable expectation" that the violations will not recur, see Gluth , 951 F.2d at 1507 , the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering expanded hours to prevent Defendants from reverting to their prior practice.
Fifty hours per week does not constitute "unlimited access."
See Lindquist , 776 F.2d at 858 .
Indeed, this relief, which amounts to approximately seven hours per day, is less than the eleven hours per day ordered in Lindquist .
Id. 3.
Legal Assistance Defendants erroneously assert that the injunction mandates legal assistance for all prisoners.
Consistent with Bounds , the injunction explicitly states that legal assistance should be provided to prisoners who "because of language factors or lack of access to the law library, or for other reasons, are unable to perform adequate legal research and writing."
Permanent Injunction at 11.
The training videotape for all the prisoners, to which Defendants object, does not constitute "legal assistance."
Rather, it is a form of self-help that the district court, in its discretion, concluded would make the law library accessible to the prisoners.
Defendants also have not shown any hardship that would result from making the videotape available to all the prisoners.
ADOC has already ordered the tape to train the law clerks and legal assistants.
4.
Library Staff Contrary to Defendants' assertion, the injunction does not require each librarian to possess a law degree or paralegal degree.
Rather, the injunction requires "professionally trained" librarians who must possess either a library science degree, law degree, or paralegal degree.
Permanent Injunction at 7-8.
While we express no opinion on whether the librarian should be trained in the law, at the very least, it is not unreasonable to ensure that the librarian is in fact trained for the demands of his or her job through the requirement of a library science degree and a basic knowledge of legal research.
5.
Indigency Standard The district court ordered ADOC to set the indigency standard at $46.
However, as discussed above, because the district court did not make a specific finding as to the inadequacy of ADOC's current standard, we vacate this provision of the injunction and remand for a proper finding.
Because Plaintiffs do not challenge Defendants' objection to the order requiring ADOC to provide typewriters, we vacate that provision of the injunction (Section III.C.).
6.
Photocopy Policy Similarly, because Plaintiffs do not object to an increase of photocopying costs from five cents per page to eight cents per page, we remand this issue to the district court to determine whether the increase is justified.
We affirm the requirement that ADOC post a sign by the photocopy machine directing staff not to read inmates' legal materials.
Not only does this relief fall entirely within the discretion of the district court, but Defendants also concede that it is "innocuous."
Appellants' Reply Brief at 15.
7.
Attorney Telephone Calls We affirm the requirement that prisoners be allowed at least three twenty-minute phone calls per week to their attorneys.
The order certainly does not ignore, as Defendants contend, ADOC's preference that such communications occur through written correspondence or in-person interviews.
It is undisputed that ADOC can implement this provision at little cost since the prisoner either calls collect or pays for the calls.
Furthermore, this provision can potentially save staff time because it would no longer be necessary for the staff to determine which phone calls qualify as an emergency.
D. Defendants' Failure to Preserve their Objections Plaintiffs contend that with respect to the functions of the legal assistants, ADOC never contested the relevant provision in the proposed order, thereby waiving its right to object after the final order was entered.
However, Plaintiffs' citation of Gluth is inapposite because we held there that the defendants should have raised an argument on an issue when the district court entered its partial final judgment, which effectively closed that issue.
951 F.2d at 1511 .
Because the proposed order here does not constitute a final judgment, we reject Plaintiffs' argument that Defendants failed to preserve their objections.
Moreover, in Gluth , despite the defendants' failure, we saw no reason to bar them from raising the issue on appeal.
Id. E. Payment of the Special Master's Fees Defendants request that it be given an opportunity to object to the fees , as well as the costs and expenses of the Special Master.
Plaintiffs do not oppose this request.
In any event, it would be unfair to order Defendants to pay the fees without an opportunity to object.
Accordingly, we remand the order of reference to the district court to incorporate Defendants' request for an opportunity to object to the fees of the Special Master.
CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM in part, and VACATE and REMAND in part.
