 PER CURIAM.
Appellant, Ralph G. Lemke, was indicted for violating Alaska Compiled Laws Annotated 1949, 65-5-81, was arraigned, pleaded not guilty, was tried and, on February 27, 1952, was found guilty.
A judgment sentencing appellant was entered on March 14, 1952.
From that judgment--the only judgment entered in the case--no appeal was taken.
However, on March 11, 1952, three days before the judgment was entered, appellant took what purported to be an appeal from a judgment entered on March 10, 1952.
There was no such judgment.
Therefore the appeal is dismissed.
Cf. Prickett v. Consolidated Liquidating Corp. , 9 Cir., 180 F.2d 8 .
