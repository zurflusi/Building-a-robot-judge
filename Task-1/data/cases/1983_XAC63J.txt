 FERGUSON , Circuit Judge: Defendants were convicted after a jury trial of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute and related felony drug offenses.
They appeal on numerous grounds, most of which are disposed of by memorandum decision of this date.
We deal here only with the contention that the trial court committed reversible error by questioning a juror during the course of the trial outside the presence of any of the defendants.
We agree and reverse the convictions.
FACTS On the first day of trial, one of the jurors noticed defendant Gagnon sketching portraits of jury members.
Juror Garold Graham became alarmed and informed the bailiff, who in turn informed the judge.
Out of the presence of the jury, the judge told Gagnon that it was "very improper for a defendant to draw pictures of a jury while they are sitting in the box."
She confiscated the sketches and ordered Gagnon to refrain from any further drawing.
Counsel for Gagnon asked the court to determine which juror had noticed the sketching and to arrange for questioning of that juror.
The judge met with Graham in the presence of Gagnon's attorney, Robert Wolkin, in her chambers.
None of the defendants were present, nor were counsel for the government or for the other defendants.
The following took place: (RT 189-192).
A transcript of the in camera proceeding was available to all of the parties, and no defendant objected to the proceeding during the trial.
On appeal, however, all four defendants allege that this proceeding violated their sixth amendment right to an impartial jury and their statutory right to be present at every stage of their trial.
We have not considered whether the effect of this incident violated the defendants' right to an impartial jury as we have not found that one or more jurors was actually biased against any of the defendants.
However, because the defendants' right to be present at all stages of the trial was violated, that violation may have operated to allow a biased member to remain on the jury.
ANALYSIS: I. The Right of Presence The right of a criminal defendant to be present at every stage of his trial has been variously characterized as guaranteed by the due process clause of the fifth (and, in state cases, the fourteenth) amendment, the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment, or some combination thereof.
See, e.g. , Illinois v. Allen , 397 U.S. 337, 338 , 90 S.Ct. 1057, 1058 , 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970) (confrontation clause); Snyder v. Massachusetts , 291 U.S. 97, 107-08 , 54 S.Ct. 330, 332-33 , 78 L.Ed. 674 (1934) (due process); Bustamante v. Eyman , 456 F.2d 269, 273 (9th Cir.1972) (confrontation clause and due process).
The precise source of the right often depends on the context in which the alleged violation occurred.
See Shields v. United States , 273 U.S. 583, 588 , 47 S.Ct. 478, 479 , 71 L.Ed. 787 (1927) ("rule of orderly conduct of jury trial").
Regardless of its source, the right itself has been recognized throughout the development of American criminal jurisprudence.
"A leading principle that pervades the entire law of criminal procedure is that, after indictment found, nothing shall be done in the absence of the prisoner."
Lewis v. United States , 146 U.S. 370, 372 , 13 S.Ct. 136, 137 , 36 L.Ed. 1011 (1892).
However, "it has seldom been necessary to plumb the federal constitutional depths of the principle," Bustamante , 456 F.2d at 273 , because most jurisdictions recognize the principle through statute or rule.
In federal criminal trials, the right is codified in Fed.R.Crim.P.
43.
With a few specific exceptions not relevant here, Rule 43 requires the presence of the defendant "at every stage of the trial including the impaneling of the jury and the return of the verdict."
The constitution, principles of jury trial, and Rule 43 all guarantee a defendant the right to be present during communications between the judge and the jury.
Rogers v. United States , 422 U.S. 35, 39 , 95 S.Ct. 2091, 2094 , 45 L.Ed.2d 1 (1975) (Rule 43 and prior decisions); Shields , 273 U.S. at 588-89 , 47 S.Ct. at 479 (orderly conduct of jury trial); Bustamante , 456 F.2d at 273 (constitutional right).
However that guarantee is not absolute.
The defendant's presence is not required in those situations where his presence would be useless, or the benefit but a shadow.
Snyder v. Massachusetts , 291 U.S. at 108 , 54 S.Ct. at 333 (no constitutional right to accompany the jury on a view because the defendant's absence could have no effect); see also Faretta v. California , 422 U.S. 806, 819 n. 15, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2533 n. 15, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975).
Generally, the absence of a defendant from an in camera conference between a juror and the court where the court seeks to determine the juror's bias is held to be harmless error either because the conference dealt with an issue of law and was thus exempt under Fed.R.Crim.P.
43(c) or because the defendant's rights were fully protected by counsel.
In United States v. Polizzi , 500 F.2d 856 (9th Cir.1974), the possibility of juror bias against the defendant arose from newspaper publicity about the case printed during trial.
The court found: Silverthorne v. United States 400 F.2d 627, 643 in camera Id. at 880 .
However, the issue is not as simple in the instant case. The potential bias here did not arise from outside sources such as newspaper reports with which the defendant had no connection.
Rather it arose through the in-court activities of the defendant which not only took place in the presence of the jury, but directly involved the jury.
The government relies upon this reasoning to argue that the presence of defendants Valenzuela, Storms and Martin, who were not even represented by counsel at the in camera proceeding, was unnecessary as only defendant Gagnon was involved.
However, in a conspiracy case the evidence presented must link the defendants together in order to establish concert of action.
A co-conspirator is vicariously liable for the acts of another co-conspirator even though he may not have directly participated in those acts, his role in the crime was minor, or the evidence against a co-defendant more damaging.
United States v. Saavedra , 684 F.2d 1293, 1300-01 (9th Cir.1982), citing United States v. Basey , 613 F.2d 198, 202 (9th Cir.1979), cert. denied , 446 U.S. 919 , 100 S.Ct. 1854 , 64 L.Ed.2d 274 (1980).
Therefore, since the evidence against one defendant may be used against another, it is not unreasonable to fear that the prejudice against one may be extended to the others, especially under the facts of this case, where juror Graham apparently felt concern about the possibility of future retaliation.
Therefore, we cannot say that Gagnon's co-defendants had no stake in the determination of whether Graham could continue to be impartial, nor can we say that Gagnon's counsel could effectively safeguard their interests.
As to defendant Gagnon, although his attorney proclaimed himself satisfied with Graham's statements, the juror did indicate that another juror had also noticed Gagnon's activities.
Had Gagnon been present, he could have gauged the possibility of whether, given the distance and angle of the second juror's seating relative to himself, that second juror might have seen or guessed the subject of the pencil sketches.
Even if we were convinced that the presence of some or all of the defendants would have been but a "shadow" of benefit to them, so as to foreclose their due process right to attend the proceeding under Snyder , this circuit has stated that the protection offered by Rule 43 "is broader than the sixth amendment right to confrontation and the fifth amendment due process rights."
United States v. Christopher , 700 F.2d 1253, 1261-62 (9th Cir.1983); accord United States v. Turner , 532 F.Supp.
913, 916 (D.C.Cal.1982).
II.
Waiver Rule 43 does, of course, make provision for the absence of a defendant without written consent in certain situations.
Under subsection (c), no written consent is required for a corporation to appear by counsel, or for a defendant to be absent during discussion of a question of law or at a reduction of sentence.
United States v. Veatch , 674 F.2d 1217, 1225-26 (9th Cir.1981).
These situations are not applicable here.
Rule 43(b) also provides that "the defendant shall be considered to have waived his right to be present" when he: There is no contention that Gagnon's behavior was disruptive within the meaning of Rule 43(b)(2), and the behavior of the other defendants was not even an issue in the in camera proceeding.
Thus the question posed is whether Gagnon and/or the other defendants waived their right to be present by voluntarily absenting themselves.
As in United States v. Ford , 632 F.2d 1354, 1379 (9th Cir.1980), "[a]lthough the record suggests that [the defendant]'s absence was voluntary, we cannot conclusively determine that it was."
(Footnote omitted).
The record shows that the district judge announced in open court her intention to question juror Graham in chambers, but does not disclose how it came about that only Mr. Wolkin (Gagnon's attorney) attended the conference.
1 There is no indication of whether Gagnon or the other defendants expressly or impliedly indicated their willingness to be absent from the conference.
It is true that none of the defendants objected to the in camera proceeding during the remainder or at the close of trial, but under our analysis in Ford , that fact is relevant only to the question of resulting prejudice, not to the question of voluntary absence.
632 F.2d at 1379 .
2 The standard for determining whether a criminal defendant has waived a constitutional right is even more stringent than that provided by Rule 43(b), requiring "an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege."
Johnson v. Zerbst , 304 U.S. 458, 464 , 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023 , 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1958).
Since we are unable to conclude that defendants voluntarily absented themselves within the meaning of Rule 43(b), a fortiori we cannot conclude that they knowingly and intelligently waived their constitutional right to be present.
III.
Harmless Error Rule Although we have determined that defendants' constitutional and statutory rights were violated by an examination of a potentially biased juror in their absence, we must make one further inquiry.
With a few notable exceptions, the violation of a constitutional right does not require reversal if the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
Chapman v. California , 386 U.S. 18, 21-22 , 87 S.Ct. 824, 826-827 , 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).
The government must "prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained."
Id. at 24 , 87 S.Ct. at 828 .
The burden is on the government to establish this.
Id. at 24-26 , 87 S.Ct. at 828-829 .
And Rule 43 must be read in conjunction with Rule 52(a), which provides that "[a]ny error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded."
This circuit stated in United States v. Ford , 632 F.2d at 1379 n. 28: Akins v. Cardwell 500 F.2d 47, 47 Akins United States v. Cassasa 588 F.2d 282 cert. denied 441 U.S. 909 99 S.Ct. 2003 60 L.Ed.2d 379 Id. at 285 We need not resolve this apparent conflict in precedent.
We have stated in Part I, supra , that a reasonable possibility of prejudice arose with regard to all defendants, and thus under either the Akins or Ford test, the burden in this case must rest on the government.
Whether the government must prove that a violation of Rule 43 is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt or to some lesser degree of certainty has not been specifically addressed in this circuit.
Cf. United States v. Reynolds , 489 F.2d 4 (6th Cir.1973), cert. denied , 416 U.S. 988 , 94 S.Ct. 2395 , 40 L.Ed.2d 766 (1974) (error reversible if any reasonable possibility of prejudice); United States v. Freed , 460 F.2d 75 (10th Cir.1972) (standard is clear prejudice).
Few of our cases have had reason to explore that area of the Rule 43 presence right that is outside constitutional protection.
Given our prior finding that the defendants' due process rights were violated by proceeding in their absence without determining whether the absence was voluntary, we need only assess the prejudice in this case under a "harmless beyond a reasonable doubt" standard.
We cannot find the error here to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
The presence of the defendants was necessary in order to safeguard another constitutional right--the right to an impartial jury.
While we cannot say on this record that the right to an impartial jury was infringed, we also cannot say with assurance that the absence was harmless.
The district court is REVERSED.
