 HATTER , District Judge: Ronwin sued the Arizona State Bar ("Bar") and the individual members (and their spouses) of the Committee on Examinations and Admissions of the Arizona Supreme Court ("Committee"), alleging that they had violated federal antitrust laws in grading the 1974 Arizona bar examination that Ronwin failed.
The district court denied Ronwin's motion for recusal and dismissed the action for failure to state a claim, lack of jurisdiction, and lack of standing.
We affirm the denial of the recusal motion, but reverse the dismissal decision as to the individual committee members 1 and remand for further proceedings.
I FACTS Ronwin took the Arizona bar examination in February, 1974.
He was notified two months later that he had failed the examination.
The Arizona Supreme Court refused to review his exam, and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari.
See Ronwin v. Committee on Examination and Admissions , 419 U.S. 967 , 95 S.Ct. 231 , 42 L.Ed.2d 183 (1974).
2 Ronwin filed this antitrust action in March, 1978, alleging that defendants violated section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1 , by illegally restricting competition among attorneys practicing in Arizona.
The essence of Ronwin's complaint is that the Committee graded the exam to admit a predetermined number of persons, without reference to "achievement by each bar applicant of a pre-set standard [of competence]."
For purposes of their motion to dismiss, defendants did not challenge the accuracy of Ronwin's allegations.
3 At the time Ronwin took the bar exam, the Committee was authorized to determine whether bar applicants possessed the "necessary qualifications and fulfill[ed] the requirements prescribed by the [Bar] board of governors as approved by [the Arizona Supreme Court] " Ariz.Sup.Ct.
Rule 28(a) (1973) (amended in 1975 to create two separate committees).
The Committee consists of seven active members of the State Bar who, upon the recommendation of the Bar's Board of Governors, are appointed by the Arizona Supreme Court.
Id .
As Ronwin noted in paragraph II of his complaint, the State Bar is a private entity to which all Arizona lawyers belong, and the individual defendants were members of "the Committee and, as such, presided over and conducted the process by which applicants for membership in [the] Bar were examined " II DISMISSAL OF RONWIN'S ACTION The district court gave three reasons for dismissing the action: (1) the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted; (2) the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter; and (3) Ronwin lacked standing to seek the relief requested.
These reasons will be discussed seriatim.
A. Failure to State a Claim--State-Action Immunity The district court's ruling that Ronwin had failed to state a claim was apparently based on its acceptance of defendants' argument that bar grading procedures are immune from federal antitrust laws.
Relying primarily on Bates v. State Bar of Arizona , 433 U.S. 350 , 97 S.Ct. 2691 , 53 L.Ed.2d 810 (1977), the defendants argue that, even assuming, arguendo , the grading formula was anticompetitive, the Committee's status as a state agent renders its actions absolutely immune from antitrust liability.
We disagree.
In Bates , the Supreme Court held that a disciplinary rule adopted by the Arizona Supreme Court and enforced by the Arizona state bar, which prohibited lawyers from advertising, did not violate the federal antitrust laws under the state-action exemption first announced in Parker v. Brown , 317 U.S. 341 , 63 S.Ct. 307 , 87 L.Ed. 315 (1943).
433 U.S. at 359-61 , 97 S.Ct. at 2696-97 .
The Court stressed that the real party in interest was the Arizona Supreme Court because it had adopted the challenged restraint.
Because the challenged restraint had been specifically adopted by the state acting, through the State Supreme Court, as sovereign, it therefore reflected a clear and affirmative articulation of state policy.
Id. at 361-62 , 97 S.Ct. at 2697-98 .
In the present case, by contrast, the challenged restraint was not adopted or directly authorized by the Arizona Supreme Court.
In a more analogous case, the Supreme Court held that the activities of a county and a state bar association in publishing and enforcing a minimum-fee schedule were not shielded by the state-action exemption.
Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar , 421 U.S. 773, 788-92 , 95 S.Ct. 2004, 2013-15 , 44 L.Ed.2d 572 (1975).
The Court stated: Parker v. Brown 317 U.S. at 350-352 63 S.Ct. at 313-14 Continental Co. v. Union Carbide 370 U.S. 690, 706-07 82 S.Ct. 1404, 1414-15 8 L.Ed.2d 777 Id. at 790-91 , 95 S.Ct. at 2014-15 .
Subsequent Supreme Court decisions underscore the distinction between Bates and Goldfarb .
The Court has repeatedly emphasized in these more recent decisions that for the state-action exemption to apply the challenged restraint must be clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy and be actively supervised by the state itself.
See, e.g. , City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co. , 435 U.S. 389, 410-13 , 98 S.Ct. 1123, 1135-36 , 55 L.Ed.2d 364 (1978); New Motor Vehicle Board of California v. Orrin W. Fox Co. , 439 U.S. 96, 109 , 99 S.Ct. 403, 411 , 58 L.Ed.2d 361 (1978); California Retail Liquor Dealers Association v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc. , 445 U.S. 97, 105 , 100 S.Ct. 937, 943 , 63 L.Ed.2d 233 (1980); Community Communications Co. v. City of Boulder , 455 U.S. 40, 48-51 , 102 S.Ct. 835, 839-41 , 70 L.Ed.2d 810 (1982).
The failure to meet either requirement precludes application of the antitrust immunity.
Midcal , 445 U.S. at 105 , 100 S.Ct. at 943 .
Viewing the present case at this stage of the proceedings in light of the Court's state-action requirements, we conclude that the challenged grading procedure fails to qualify for antitrust immunity.
It has not been established that the alleged restraint was "clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy," Midcal 's first requirement.
Id. Like the defendants in Goldfarb , the defendants here have no statute or Supreme Court Rule to point to as directly requiring the challenged grading procedure.
4 See 421 U.S. at 790-91 , 95 S.Ct. at 2014-15 .
The fact that the Arizona Supreme Court has delegated to the Committee the general authority to examine applicants to determine if they are qualified to practice law and reviews the Committee's recommendations regarding admission does not alone clothe the Committee's unilateral grading policies with blanket immunity from the antitrust laws.
"The national policy in favor of competition cannot be thwarted by casting such a gauzy cloak of state involvement" over actions of the Committee that were not affirmatively expressed as state policy by the Arizona court.
Midcal , 445 U.S. at 106 , 100 S.Ct. at 943 .
As the Court emphasized in Goldfarb , "[i]t is not enough that, as the Bar puts it, anticompetitive conduct is 'prompted' by state action; rather, anticompetitive activities must be compelled by direction of the State acting as a sovereign."
421 U.S. at 791 , 95 S.Ct. at 2015 .
Accord , Phonetele, Inc. v. American Telephone and Telegraph Co. , 664 F.2d 716, 736 (9th Cir. 1981).
The fact that the Committee was established by Supreme Court Rule and composed of members selected from the Bar by the Arizona Supreme Court is not, as defendants assert, dispositive in itself of the state-action question.
5 Although the defendants in the United States Supreme Court's state-action decisions were public bodies, or subdivisions of the state, that did not end the Court's analysis.
The Court still looked to see whether the challenged restraints were clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy and were actively supervised by the state acting as sovereign.
Thus, for instance, it was not dispositive that the restraints challenged in Parker , Orrin W. Fox , and Midcal were enforced, respectively, by a state commission, a state board, and a state department.
317 U.S. at 344 , 63 S.Ct. at 310 ; 439 U.S. at 103 , 99 S.Ct. at 408 ; 445 U.S. at 100 , 100 S.Ct. at 940 .
In City of Lafayette , 435 U.S. at 408 , 98 S.Ct. at 1134 , a plurality of the Court expressly rejected the argument that the state-action exemption extends to "all governmental entities, whether state agencies or subdivisions of a State simply by reason of their status as such."
This position has since been adopted by a majority of the Court.
See City of Boulder , U.S. at , 102 S.Ct. at 842 .
The question remains whether the challenged restraint allegedly fashioned by the Committee was sufficiently "articulated" and "supervised" by the Arizona Supreme Court.
Standing alone, the fact that the court established the Committee and selected its members does not affect the reasoning underlying our conclusion that the challenged grading procedure was not clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy, Midcal 's first requirement.
Effective January 15, 1974, 45 days before the examination Ronwin failed, the Arizona Supreme Court adopted Rule 28(c)(VII)(B) which requires the Committee to file its proposed grading formula with the Supreme Court at least 30 days before each examination.
This review procedure was not brought to the attention of the district court either in the pleadings or in the papers pertaining to the motion to dismiss; nor did the parties mention it in their briefs or arguments to this court.
Defendants contend for the first time on rehearing that the Committee's grading formula "was submitted to the Court, reviewed by the Court, and accepted by the Court."
In response, Ronwin has tendered to this court what purports to be the letter the Committee filed with the Supreme Court on February 8, 1974 pursuant to Rule 28(c)(VII)(B) .
If, as Ronwin alleges, the Committee scored the examination to admit a pre-determined number of applicants, the letter does not so advise the court.
Accordingly, if the letter presented to us constitutes the submission to the Supreme Court, it cannot be the basis for a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy.
Although dismissal might have been proper if the facts were as defendants now argue for the first time on rehearing, those facts were never brought to the district court's attention.
Dismissal was therefore improper on the basis of the information before the district court.
Our resolution of the state-action issue is not inconsistent with this court's prior decisions in Hackin v. Lockwood , 361 F.2d 499 (9th Cir. 1966); Chaney v. State Bar of California , 386 F.2d 962 (9th Cir. 1967), cert. denied , 390 U.S. 1011 , 88 S.Ct. 1262 , 20 L.Ed.2d 162 (1968); and Brown v. Board of Bar Examiners , 623 F.2d 605 (9th Cir. 1980).
Those decisions do not support the contention that bar grading procedures are always shielded by state-action immunity, that such procedures may be challenged only on constitutional grounds, or that the Arizona Supreme Court was the proper defendant in this case. Those cases did not involve antitrust challenges to bar grading procedures.
The plaintiffs in all three cases based their claims on alleged violations of their individual constitutional rights.
6 The national policy in favor of competition, Midcal , 445 U.S. at 106 , 100 S.Ct. at 943 , should not be thwarted absent a clear articulation by the Arizona Supreme Court that it had adopted the alleged grading policy.
Absent such a declaration, Ronwin should not have been denied the opportunity to prove that the grading policy was designed to limit competition among Arizona attorneys, as opposed to being designed to ensure that attorneys had the necessary qualifications.
Thus, Ronwin's action should not have been dismissed on the ground that the defendants enjoy absolute state-action immunity.
B. Subject Matter Jurisdiction--Interstate Commerce The Sherman Act's requirement of interstate commerce, 15 U.S.C. 1 , is jurisdictional.
See Western Waste Service Systems v. Universal Waste Control , 616 F.2d 1094, 1097 (9th Cir.), cert. denied , 449 U.S. 869 , 101 S.Ct. 205 , 66 L.Ed.2d 88 (1980); see generally McLain v. Real Estate Board , 444 U.S. 232 , 100 S.Ct. 502 , 62 L.Ed.2d 441 (1980).
The district court evidently found that the alleged restraint did not affect interstate commerce so as to invoke jurisdiction under the Sherman Act.
Defendants contend that the jurisdictional requirement of the Sherman Act was not satisfied by Ronwin's complaint because bar admission is a purely local matter.
Ronwin responds that the services of Arizona lawyers are required by people living outside Arizona.
The price paid by these out-of-state clients for legal services performed by Arizona lawyers is, according to Ronwin, higher than it would be if the number of Arizona lawyers had not been artificially restricted.
In order to establish jurisdiction under the antitrust laws, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant's activity either (1) is itself in commerce or (2) "has an effect on some other appreciable activity demonstrably in interstate commerce ."
McLain , 444 U.S. at 242 , 100 S.Ct. at 509 (emphasis added).
Because of the past confusion surrounding these tests, we will consider Ronwin's allegations of interstate commerce under both the "in commerce" and the "effect on commerce" tests.
See Bain v. Henderson , 621 F.2d 959, 960 n.1 (9th Cir. 1980).
(1) The "in commerce" test : The most applicable Supreme Court decision applying the "in commerce" test is Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar , 421 U.S. at 783-86 , 95 S.Ct. at 2011-12 .
In Goldfarb , plaintiffs alleged that the Virginia State Bar was fixing the prices charged by lawyers handling real estate transactions.
In upholding jurisdiction, the Court noted that the real estate transactions that require legal services are frequently interstate transactions.
421 U.S. at 783-84 , 95 S.Ct. at 2011-12 .
The Court reasoned that any restraint on those services therefore had a substantial effect on interstate commerce.
Id. at 785 , 95 S.Ct. at 2012 .
Ronwin did not specifically plead which interstate transactions require legal services.
See Bain , 621 F.2d at 961 .
Nor did he indicate how substantial an effect on interstate commerce results from restricting the number of lawyers practicing in Arizona.
It is not inconceivable, however, that he could establish that legal services constitute an indispensable and inseparable component of certain interstate transactions.
Therefore, the district court erred in dismissing the complaint for that reason at this stage of the proceedings.
See McLain , 444 U.S. at 246 , 100 S.Ct. at 511 (a complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief).
(2) The "effect on commerce" test : In McLain , plaintiffs charged that various New Orleans-based real estate brokers were engaged in a price-fixing conspiracy.
The Court held that plaintiffs had alleged facts sufficient to show that defendants' conduct affected interstate commerce.
7 McLain , 444 U.S. at 245 , 100 S.Ct. at 510 .
Specifically, the Court noted indications in the record that: (1) "an appreciable amount of commerce [was] involved in the financing of residential property in the Greater New Orleans area" and the commerce involved various interstate institutions, id. at 245 , 100 S.Ct. at 510 ; and (2) the activities of the real estate brokers, by affecting the terms and frequency of local real estate transactions, could have a "not insubstantial effect on interstate commerce."
Id. at 246 , 100 S.Ct. at 511 .
Ronwin did not allege either that there are an appreciable number of interstate transactions taking place in Arizona that require legal services or that limiting the number of lawyers has a not insubstantial effect on the number or size of these transactions.
However, as is also true under the "in commerce" test, it is not inconceivable that Ronwin could establish jurisdiction under the "effect on commerce" test.
See, e.g. , McLain , 444 U.S. at 245-47 , 100 S.Ct. at 510-11 ; Western Waste Service , 616 F.2d at 1097-99 .
Therefore, on remand, the district court should give Ronwin the opportunity to prove that his complaint meets the jurisdictional requirements under either of these tests.
C. Standing In order to have standing to maintain a private antitrust action, a party must allege injury to the party's business or property occurring by reason of the alleged antitrust violation.
15 U.S.C. 15 ; Solinger v. A&M Records, Inc. , 586 F.2d 1304, 1309 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied , 441 U.S. 908 , 99 S.Ct. 1999 , 60 L.Ed.2d 377 (1979).
Defendants contend that even if they committed an antitrust violation, the violation did not cause Ronwin injury because he was subsequently found mentally unfit to engage in the practice of law.
Thus, according to defendants, even if Ronwin had passed the exam, he would not have been admitted to practice in Arizona.
The flaw in the defendants' argument is that Ronwin was not found mentally unfit to practice law by the Arizona Supreme Court until July of 1976, twenty-seven months after Ronwin's exam results were released.
8 If Ronwin had passed the exam, he arguably would have been able to practice law until he was found, by final decision, to be mentally unfit.
Because defendants' alleged illegal restraint precluded Ronwin from practicing law in Arizona for an appreciable period of time, Ronwin has sufficiently alleged that he was injured by reason of an unlawful practice.
See Kapp v. National Football League , 586 F.2d 644, 648 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied , 441 U.S. 907 , 99 S.Ct. 1996 , 60 L.Ed.2d 375 (1979).
Cf. Solinger , 586 F.2d at 1311 (prospective purchaser of company has standing to sue companies that allegedly foreclosed his ability to enter market).
Although his allegations of damages suffice to confer standing, Ronwin will still have to prove that defendants' actions caused him actual damages in order to recover.
9 III THE RECUSAL QUESTION Ronwin appeals the denial of his recusal motion.
The district judge was also presiding at that time over other actions in which Ronwin was a party.
Ronwin set forth, in various affidavits and motions, facts which he contends indicated that the judge was biased and prejudiced against him.
He contends that the judge was therefore required to recuse himself pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 144 and 455 .
10 The test for disqualification is the same under sections 144 and 455(b)(1) .
United States v. Sibla , 624 F.2d 864, 867 (9th Cir. 1980).
That test is whether "a reasonable person with knowledge of all the facts would conclude that the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned."
United States v. Winston , 613 F.2d 221, 222 (9th Cir. 1980).
In evaluating a judge's impartiality, the bias or prejudice "must stem from an extrajudicial source ."
Azhocar , 581 F.2d at 739 (emphasis in original).
We review the denial of a recusal motion for abuse of discretion.
Sibla , 624 F.2d at 868-69 .
Ronwin's specific allegations of bias or prejudice involve judicial acts which the district judge either performed or failed to perform while presiding over the other actions in which Ronwin was a party.
None of these actions involved extra-judicial acts which would indicate, on their face, prejudice or bias.
Adverse rulings by themselves do not constitute the requisite bias or prejudice.
Azhocar , 581 F.2d at 738-39 .
Ronwin also contends that the judge was prejudiced against him because the judge was a defendant in an action brought by Ronwin.
However, "[a] judge is not disqualified merely because a litigant sues or threatens to sue him."
United States v. Grismore , 564 F.2d 929, 933 (10th Cir. 1977), cert. denied , 435 U.S. 954 , 98 S.Ct. 1586 , 55 L.Ed.2d 806 (1978).
Such an easy method for obtaining disqualification should not be encouraged or allowed.
Finally, Ronwin contends that the judge's alleged participation in ex parte communications with defense counsel indicated the judge's prejudice.
Although a judge is generally required to accept the truth of the factual assertions in an Affidavit of Bias filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 144 , Azhocar , 581 F.2d at 739 , Ronwin's allegation of ex parte communications relates to facts that were peculiarly within the judge's knowledge. 11 Given the judge's emphatic denial of Ronwin's allegations, and Ronwin's failure to show how such alleged communications indicated the judge's prejudice, the judge did not abuse his discretion by denying Ronwin's motion.
IV CONCLUSION We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for recusal.
We also conclude, however, that the court erred in dismissing the action as to the individual Committee members, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
12 AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.
