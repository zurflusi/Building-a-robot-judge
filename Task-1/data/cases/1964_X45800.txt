 BARNES , Circuit Judge.
This is an appeal from a judgment of dismissal below, upon the sole ground the statute of limitations had run against The Progress Company on its cause of action against appellees, filed September 28, 1956.
The action was for treble damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Act ( 15 U.S.C. 15 ), arising from the alleged violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1 and 2).
Jurisdiction below rested on Section 1337 of Title 28 United States Code, and rests here on Sections 1291 and 1294(1) of Title 28 United States Code.
It is conceded by appellants that their cause of action accrued no later than February 1954, and that the applicable statute of limitations began to run at that time.
The question before us is first: What is the applicable statute of limitations?
And, second: Whether (if the one year statute Cal.Code Civ.P.
340(1) is applicable, rather than the three year statute Cal.Code Civ.P.
338(1) ) it was tolled or suspended under 5 of the Clayton Act ( 15 U.S.C. 16 , as amended, 15 U.S.C. 16(b) , 1955) by a similar proceeding "instituted by the United States."
The alleged similar proceeding was United States v. Standard Oil Co., et al., Civil No. 11584-C, heretofore pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (the same district from which this case arose, although the cases were assigned to and tried by different judges).
Seven specifications of error raise the above primary questions.
They need not here be quoted in full.
The appellees likewise raise two separate defenses, 1 which need not here be considered in view of our subsequent primary conclusions.
It is further conceded by both parties that the four year federal limitations period with respect to private causes of action under the antitrust laws is inapplicable to a cause accruing in 1954; and that resort must be had to state law.
( Steiner v. 20th Century-Fox Film Corp. , 9 Cir. 1956, 232 F.2d 190, 194 .
2 ) The difficulty with the "solution" of "looking to state laws" is that there the problem starts.
3 I This action is one where much can be said on both sides.
Where a strong diversity of judicial opinion exists, and we attempt to prognosticate (as all other federal courts must who face the problem) the result at which a state court would arrive, we find many gray areas.
Are we to consider what our opinion might be, based on an original solution of the problem, or are we to consider the trial court's conclusion and opinion, and determine only whether it is clearly erroneous?
We conclude the latter is the proper measuring stick, and under it, after some soul searching, we affirm the district court.
We are reminded of what Judge Wyzanski said so frankly to a jury in a private treble damage antitrust action ( Cape Cod Food Products v. National Cranberry Association , D.Mass.1954, 119 F.Supp.
900, 910 ) speaking of damages, "You can't go to a book and look for the answer."
The California Code of Civil Procedure 335 and 338(1) read as follows (in pertinent part): 335 338 California Code of Civil Procedure, 340(1) reads as follows (in pertinent part): 340 Is the action based upon a statutory penalty or forfeiture, or is it an action based upon a liability created by statute other than a penalty or forfeiture?
4 In considering this question, it is our problem, as it was that of the court below, to determine not what we would rule were it a case of first impression before us, but which of said statutes a California court would apply if it had jurisdiction of this case. Hall v. Copco Pacific, Ltd. , 9 Cir., 1955, 224 F.2d 884 .
Appellants have five prongs to their spear in their attack on the one year penal statute interpretation.
We discuss each of appellants' contentions in turn.
(A) Appellants suggest that "at least one California trial court has construed the action as compensatory rather than penal."
This decision is unreported, but what purports to be a certified copy of a "Memorandum and Order on Demurrers and Motions to Strike" is attached to appellants' opening brief as an appendix.
It is from the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Fresno, No. 97179, and is entitled "Charles S. Ehrhorn, d.b.a.
Navy Gas Co., Plaintiff, vs.
Caminol Company, et al, Defendants."
The trial judge in Ehrhorn v. Caminol Co., supra , first sustains certain general and special demurrers, and grants leave to amend.
He likewise states: "The Court is of the opinion that the three year statute of limitations applies."
This is a state action based on the Cartwright Act, a state antitrust statute.
No reasons are given for the holding; and no authority is cited.
We do not know what the precise issue was, raised by the pleadings then before the trial judge, or whether he was merely delivering "an advisory opinion" to aid counsel for plaintiffs therein in drafting his required new complaint.
We think it of some, but little, precedential value.
We adopt in this connection a portion of appellees' argument, appearing in their opening brief: Stevens v. Key-Resistor Corp. 186 C.A.2d 325 8 Cal.Rptr.
908 Carley v. City of Santa Rosa 154 C.A.2d 214 315 P.2d 905 Curnutt v. Holk 203 A.C.A.

354 , Judge Kloeb, a trial judge experienced in antitrust litigation, held that treble damages awarded under the Robinson-Patman Act were remedial rather than penal, and in doing so, considered whether a federal court, in determining what state law is or is to be, and eliminating "other persuasive evidence," must follow (a) the Supreme Court of that state; (b) an intermediate appellate court; (c) lower state courts of original jurisdiction.
He stated the answers are to (a) "Yes."

The federal courts, he concludes, may or may not follow the lower state courts, as they think proper.
In deciding the matter, Judge Kloeb relied on many of the cases later cited and discussed herein ( 109 F.Supp.
p. 363 ).
(B) Turning to the cases which appellants list as recognizing the three year statute, we find the following listed: Burnham Chemical Co. v. Borax Consolidated , 9 Cir., 1948, 170 F.2d 569, 578 , cert. den.
336 U.S. 924 , 69 S.Ct. 655 , 93 L.Ed. 1086 , reh.

340 U.S. 943 , 71 S.Ct. 506 , 95 L.Ed. 680 , reh.
den.
341 U.S. 912 , 71 S.Ct. 620 , 95 L.Ed. 1349 ; Steiner v. 20th Century-Fox Film Corp. supra .
(In the last two cases cited the authority is dimmed somewhat by the fact the parties agreed that the three year statute applied.)
Four district court decisions are then listed--two each from Northern and Southern California: Aero Sales Co. v. Columbia Steel Co. , N.D.Cal.1954, 119 F.Supp.
693 ; Manny v. Warner Bros. Pictures , S.D.Cal.1953, 116 F.Supp.
807 ; Levy v. Paramount Pictures , N.D.Cal.1952, 104 F.Supp.
787 ; United West Coast Theatres Corp. v. South Side Theatres , S.D.Cal.
1949, 86 F.Supp.
109 .
In the Burnham Chemical Co. case, supra , a reading indicates that this court stated ( 170 F.2d at p. 578 ): "The [trial] court therefore properly held the cause barred by Section 338(1) of the California statute of limitations."
(Emphasis added.)
The "therefore" refers to the fact that "the only damages for which a recovery might be had (under federal antitrust laws) are those which accrued and were suffered within three years prior to the filing of the complaint and the record reveals that none were shown during this period."
Obviously if no damages could be shown during a three year period immediately prior to the filing of the complaint, none could be shown during the one year period prior to the filing of the complaint; hence no choice between the two periods was offered the court, nor any choice between the two periods necessary or required.
Thus a reading of Burnham , supra , Suckow Borax Mines , supra , and Steiner v. 20th Century-Fox , supra , indicates that in none of these has the precise issue here present been met.
In the first it was not necessary because of the facts; in the last two, the three year statute was agreed upon by the parties as applicable.
5 In Aero Sales Co. v. Columbia Steel Co. , N.D.Cal.1954, 119 F.Supp.
693 , Judge Harris held that Judge Goodman, in Wolfe v. National Lead Co., 6 had already decided the question that the treble damage provision of the Clayton Act was not penal, hence the three year statute prevailed, and that Judge Harris concurred despite "persuasive arguments" in favor of the one year penalty theory.
Judge Harris also referred to the United West Coast Theatres ( supra ) opinion which was written by Judge Mathes (the same judge who came to the opposite conclusion in our instant case).
Judge Harris discussed and differentiated Ben C. Jones & Co. v. West Publishing Co. , 5 Cir. 1921, 270 F. 563 , dismissed, 270 U.S. 665 , 46 S.Ct. 208 , 70 L.Ed. 789 , upon two grounds--(1) it had not been followed, either in the courts of Texas nor in the federal courts sitting in that state, and (2) that in the Jones case, the four year statute was an effective bar, without a consideration or discussion as to whether the two year Texas statute prevailed, as the action was barred by either statute of limitations.
In Manny v. Warner Bros. , supra , Judge Westover specifically noted: 340 338 116 F.Supp.
at 808-809 In Levy v. Paramount Pictures , supra , Judge Carter assumed the three year statute applied, without the necessity of determining whether the one year statute was applicable.
In United West Coast Theatres Corp. v. South Side Theatres , supra , Judge Mathes, after reciting that the California courts had not decided the point ( 86 F.Supp.
at 110 ), ruled: 338(1) Judge Mathes then cites Fleitmann v. Welsbach Street Lighting Co. , 1916, 240 U.S. 27, 29 , 36 S.Ct. 233 , 60 L.Ed. 505 ; United Copper Securities Co. v. Amalgamated Copper Co. , 1917, 244 U.S. 261 , 37 S.Ct. 509 , 61 L.Ed. 1119 , and relies upon Burnham Chemical , supra , already discussed as a ninth circuit case supporting his position, and refers to Foster & Kleiser Co. v. Special Site Sign Co. , 9 Cir. 1936, 85 F.2d 742, 751-753 , cert. den.
299 U.S. 613 , 57 S.Ct. 315 , 81 L.Ed. 452 ; Culver v. Bell & Loffland , 9 Cir. 1944, 146 F.2d 29, 31 , and states: 338(1) In reversing his position in his reexamination of the problem in this case, Judge Mathes gave it careful study.

While appellees cite cases from six other state jurisdictions supporting their position, we do not feel that the manner in which other state courts interpret their particular statutes would foretell what the California courts might do, absent an almost unanimous rule in other states.
Such unanimity of opinion in other states does not exist.
We agree with appellants (Reply Brief, p. 6): We realize that Judge Murphy in McLean v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., No. 30262 (in proceedings had on January 10, 1958), held the three year statute applicable, stating: Section 338(1) 8 He cited the cases we have discussed above, his former opinion in Samuel Goldwyn Productions, Inc. v. Fox West Coast Theatres Corp. , N.D.Cal.1956, 146 F.Supp.
905 , and Christensen v. Paramount Pictures , D.Utah 1950, 95 F.Supp.
446, 449 .
In Goldwyn, it was said: 338(1) 146 F.Supp.
at 906 In Christensen , supra , Judge Ritter said: 95 F.Supp.
at 449 9 (C) Appellants also make limited reference to the 1914 Congressional Record; and the 1950 Congressional Record listing of the State of California as having a three year statute ( 96 Cong.Rec.
10439 -41 (1950)).
We note that Senator Hoar, the author (or at least the person in charge of the bill in the Senate) referred to the threefold damage provision as "establishing a penalty purely penal and punitive ."
(Emphasis added.
21 Cong.Rec.
3146 -47 (1890).)
(D) Heavy emphasis is placed by appellants on a law review article authored by Professor Lawrence Vold, appearing in 28 Ky.L.J.
117, particularly 152-159 (1940), entitled: "Are Threefold Damages Under the Anti-Trust Act Penal or Compensatory?"
Starting with II Samuel (Chapter 12, Verses 1-6), he represents that the criminal punishment (death) therein decreed was alone "penal," that the "lamb restored fourfold" was "reparation" to the injured party, and nothing more.
We agree with Professor Vold when he states "the available terminology relating to damages and penalties is very slippery language."
He buttresses his argument by suggesting that the "defendant" both in the Bible and in antitrust litigation is a "rich and powerful wrongdoer," while the plaintiff is "a very poor man, who has but his own little business to which he devotes his life" (p. 120), that there are "intangible elements to which no definite measure in pecuniary loss can readily be applied" (p. 124)--these he groups and describes as "accumulative harm" (p. 125).
Professor Vold disagrees, for example, with Judge Runyon in his opinion in Haskell v. Perkins , D.C.N.J.1928, 28 F.2d 222 , reversed on other grounds, 31 F.2d 53 , wherein that court stated (with considerable logic): "Consequently," says Professor Vold, Judge Runyon's conclusion appears to us to be correct, unless we assume that "unprovable" compensation in excess of full provable compensation can be something other than punitive damages.
If it cannot be compensation, and cannot be punitive, then what is it?
Because "accumulative harm" is difficult or impossible of proof, says the Professor, some or all of whatever damages are awarded beyond provable compensation must be classified as compensatory damages and not penal.
We think one purpose of a "penalty" in the antitrust statutes is to award damages for losses that are either difficult of proof, or cannot be precisely ascertained (and hence are incapable of proof as compensatory damages), as well as to discourage the anticompetitive activities which gave rise to the antitrust cause of action.
But no matter the reason, the amount awarded over and above compensation is to penalize--to do more than compensate.
This does not mean we need disagree with Professor Vold that "the threefold damage provision as used in the federal anti-trust act is not a provision for a penalty, using that term in the strict sense of a payment exacted and collected by the state as a punishment by way of example to deter other evildoers ."
(P. 158; emphasis added.)
10 Punishment and deterring effect is certainly part of its purpose, but it may well have a second purpose; that of awarding damages beyond those compensable damages capable of proof.
The provisions of the statute giving the wronged individual the right to sue prevent the word "penalty" from being defined in such a strict sense as the law review article states.
The statute is, as has been said, " sui generis ."
Imperial Film Exch. v. General Film Co. , S.D.N.Y.1915, 244 F. 985, 987 .
Congress theorized that a useful social purpose could be accomplished if private individuals or companies can and will aid their government in enforcing anti-trust laws.
To do this they require encouragement that the private litigant may recover more than his or its actual compensatory damages.
11 What is recovered under Section 7 of the Sherman Act ( 15 U.S.C. 15 note) is no less a penalty on the wrongdoer than is the fine and imprisonment with which the sovereign can threaten the violator under Sections 1 and 2, or the forfeiture of articles transported in commerce, as provided for in Section 6 .
( 15 U.S.C. 6 .)
The treble damage provision cannot be classified as exemplary damages, in the ordinary legal sense of that phrase, for in antitrust the jury has no authority or discretion to decline to award, or as to how much to award, once the compensatory amount of damages is determined.
But we insist it has some attributes of a penal statute.
We conclude Professor Vold suggests an interesting legal theory i. e., that the courts should recognize that antitrust treble damages awards are made up of two sums, one compensatory for actual damage, and the second compensatory for accumulative intangible unprovable harm, requiring recognition that the total of the treble damages awarded was compensatory, and not penal.
But we think this emphasizes but one of the peculiar reasons underlying the adoption of our antitrust laws, and is not the sole reason underlying the provision for treble damages.
Such special, select (and perhaps deserved) interpretation must, in our opinion, await legislative action, rather than be created by judicial enactment.
(E) Finally, appellants cite federal cases from other jurisdictions where the courts have allegedly "impliedly agreed" that the private antitrust action is compensatory or remedial, rather than penal in nature; citing: Bertha Building Corp. v. National Theatres, Corp. , 2 Cir. 1959, 269 F.2d 785, 789 , cert. denied 361 U.S. 960 , 80 S.Ct. 585 , 4 L.Ed.2d 542 ; Fulton v. Loew's, Inc. , D.Kan.1953, 114 F.Supp.
676, 680 ; Christensen v. Paramount Pictures , D.Utah 1950, 95 F.Supp.
446 .
In Bertha Building Corp. v. National Theatres, Corp. , supra , the court of appeals, Judge Swan writing the opinion, considered the general rules hereinbefore enunciated, and pointed out that Judge Ryan, of the District Court for the Southern District of New York, had held the six year New York statute ( 48 , Subdivision 2, New York Civil Practice Act) applicable; not the three year ( 49 , Subdivision 3 of the New York Civil Practice Act); for the latter was not applicable "to private suits for damages which are exemplary in part but not wholly unrelated to actual loss."
( 269 F.2d at 789 .)
(This was a reference to the opinion in Leonia Amusement Corp. v. Loew's Inc. , supra , 117 F.Supp.
at 752 .)
Four years later in Banana Distributors, Inc. v. United Fruit Co. , S.D.N.Y.1957, 158 F.Supp.
160 , Judge Levet concluded the shorter three year New York statute should be applied to an action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture.
12 Judge Swan held, in Bertha Building , supra , the New York rule to be that a treble damage action in that state is not an action on a penalty statute--agreeing with Judge Ryan largely based on the persuasive New York Court of Appeals decision by Judge Desmond in Sicolo v. Prudential Savings Bank of Brooklyn , 1959, 5 N.Y.2d 254 , 184 N.Y.S.2d 100 , 157 N.E.2d 284 .
In that case a fireman sued for damages sustained by him in fighting a fire in defendant's bank building after defendant violated a safety law.
"That statute provides in substance that the injured fireman was entitled to recover his actual damages, but in no event less than $1,000, regardless of actual loss."
( 269 F.2d at 789 .)
The New York state court ruled the longer statute of limitations was applicable--because it was a liability created by statute, not a penalty or forfeiture.
In Fulton v. Loew's, Inc. , supra , 114 F.Supp.
at 680 , the court did, as appellees correctly state, take the "federal" approach--i. e., held that the federal rule as to whether the antitrust laws provided a remedial and compensatory recovery, or a penal recovery, should control over a doubtful state law.
Appellees urge and appellants concede (Opening Brief, pp.
4, 13, 22) that no such easy solution is permissible here.
In Christensen v. Paramount Pictures , supra , the judge decided the issue largely on the fact "the question has been decided by a federal district court in California and by the 9th Circuit."
(Cf.: n. 9 thereof, citing United West Coast Theatres , supra , and Burnham Chemical v. Borax Consolidated , supra .)
In Lyons v. Westinghouse Electric Corp. , 2 Cir. 1955, 222 F.2d 184 , cert. denied 350 U.S. 825 , 76 S.Ct. 52 , 100 L.Ed. 737 , Judge Learned Hand wrote, in an action for private triple damages under the antitrust laws, "The remedy provided is not solely civil; two thirds of the recovery is not remedial and inevitably presupposes a punitive purpose.
It is like a qui tam action, except that the plaintiff keeps all the penalty, instead of sharing it with the sovereign."
( Id .
222 F.2d at 189 .)
And see Judge Pope's approval of such language, for this court, in Mach-Tronics, Inc. v. Zirpoli , (9 Cir. 1963), 316 F.2d 820, 831-832 .
Judge Levet pointed out in Banana Distributors, Inc. v. United Fruit , supra , that Judge Cardozo, while on the state court, in Cox v. Lykes Bros ., 1924, 237 N.Y. 376 , 143 N.E. 226 at 227-228 , had stated: Huntington v. Attrill 146 U.S. 657, 667 13 S.Ct. 224 36 L.Ed. 1123 We have considered the great emphasis placed by appellants on two California cases, interpreting the State Cartwright Act: Milton v. Hudson Sales Corp. , 1957, 152 Cal.App.2d 418, 440 , 313 P.2d 936 , and Rolley, Inc. v. Merle Norman Cosmetics, Inc. , 1954, 129 Cal.App.2d 844, 849 , 278 P.2d 63 , 282 P.2d 991 .
The force of these exclusive dealing cases, say appellants, is that by them we are "simply referred back to the Federal cases."
(Reply B., p.
5.)
Rolley does that in determining the issue of a non-monopolistic refusal to sell, because it says both the Cartwright Act (California Bus. & Prof.Code 16600ff ) and the Sherman Act, are basically restatements of common law, although the same reasoning does not apply to the Clayton Act.
Milton v. Hudson Sales Corp. , supra , holds: "There is little doubt that cases decided under the Sherman Act and the common law policy against restraint of trade are applicable to problems arising under the Cartwright Act."
( Id .
152 Cal.App.2d at 440 , 313 P.2d at 950 ).
But neither pass upon, nor approach, the statute of limitations queston here involved, nor decide whether treble damage provisions (or, under state law Bus. & Prof.Code, 16750 , double damage provisions) are penal or remedial.
In the Loevinger article 13 quoted in Judge Mathes' decision below, there is a reference in a concluding note to an article in Northwestern University Law Review, written by a practicing lawyer who has achieved noteworthy success in the prosecution of private antitrust actions.
14 In this article, criticism is made of "The Report of the Attorney General's Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws (1955)."
The author refers to page 379 of the report, where it is stated: In all instances recompense Beyond compensation penalize penalty We are not here concerned with whether treble damages should or should not be permitted in private antitrust actions.
Congress has decided they should be.
We quote this portion of the report, and note the criticism thereof, not to prove or disprove the thesis it postulates, but to indicate the common acceptance among knowledgeable specialists in antitrust law of a belief that the trebling of damage constitutes a penal statue, and is more than remedial in nature.
The holding made by Judge Mathes, reversing his previous holdings, cannot, we firmly believe, be held clearly erroneous, and we affirm.
II Nor do we think the trial court erred in holding the statute of limitations was not tolled during the pendency of the action entitled United States v. Standard Oil Co. of California, Civil No. 11584-C. From Steiner v. 20th Century-Fox Film Corp. , supra , this court has already held: (a) The general rules of collateral estoppel apply.
"The tolling provision cannot be extended to matters which might have been but were not complained of by the United States."
( 232 F.2d at 196 .)
(b) What is contained in the two suits is determined by a comparison of the two complaints.
(c) "[T]he matters complained of in the private proceeding must be the same acts to achieve the same conspiracy complained of in the action brought by the United States.
The same means must be used to achieve the same objectives of the same conspiracies by the same defendants.
*" 15 There must be "substantial identity of subject matter."
16 None of these tests are met.
(Compare Tr. pp.
2 to 24 and Tr. pp.
1136 to 1158.)
For example, the defendants in the government suit were seven integrated oil companies and the Conservation Committee of California Oil Producers.
Neither Shell Oil Company nor the Committee were involved in the instant action.
As a second example, the conspiracy in the instant case allegedly started in 1948 and continued into 1954.
In the government case, the alleged conspiracy commenced in 1936 and was concerned exclusively with events taking place prior to May of 1950.
Thus, there were not only different overt acts charged, but different conspiracies, occurring at different times, between different parties.
III We conclude appellants' action is barred by the statute of limitations; that it was not tolled; and that the judgment below so holding was not clearly erroneous, and is affirmed.
We do not reach the two additional points raised by appellees.
