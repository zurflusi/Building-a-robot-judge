 CANBY , Circuit Judge: Defendant Rubin Gottesman appeals his conviction, after a bench trial, for violating the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977 ("Act"), 18 U.S.C. 2251 et seq.
(1988).
Gottesman was convicted of violating sections 2252(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the Act, which prohibit the distribution, receipt, or shipping of child pornography.
Gottesman challenges the Act as unconstitutional, both on its face and as applied.
We conclude that the Act is unconstitutional on its face and, therefore, reverse.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND In 1986 and 1987, an undercover police officer contacted Gottesman, the operator of X-Citement Video, Inc., and expressed interest in buying pornographic videotapes featuring one Traci Lords.
The officer stated that he wanted tapes that Lords had made when she was under the age of 18.
Gottesman eventually sold two sets of such tapes: the first was a box of 49 tapes that he sold directly to the police officer; the second was a box of 8 tapes that Gottesman sold to the police officer and sent (per the police officer's instructions) to Hawaii.
A federal grand jury indicted Gottesman for distributing, shipping, and conspiring to distribute and ship child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2252 .
After a bench trial, Gottesman was convicted on these counts; the district court sentenced him to 12 months incarceration and ordered him to pay a $100,000 fine.
After he had filed a notice of appeal to this court, Gottesman requested a remand to the district court for reconsideration in light of United States v. Thomas , 893 F.2d 1066 (9th Cir.), cert. denied , 498 U.S. 826 , 111 S.Ct. 80 , 112 L.Ed.2d 53 (1990), which we granted.
Gottesman then asserted before the district court, first, that Thomas had ruled that section 2252 lacked a requirement that a defendant know that he is distributing or shipping child pornography, and, second, that, as construed, section 2252 on its face violates the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.
The district court rejected these arguments and upheld the constitutionality of section 2252 .
On appeal, Gottesman contends that: Section 2256 of the Act 1 is unconstitutional on its face because it is vague and overbroad; section 2252 of the Act 2 is unconstitutional on its face because it does not require scienter; 3 and the Act, as applied, violates the First and Fifth Amendments because the tapes at issue are not child pornography.
We reject the challenges to section 2256 but agree that section 2252 is fatally defective.
Because we conclude that section 2252 is unconstitutional on its face, we do not reach Gottesman's argument about the Act as applied.
DISCUSSION I. Does Section 2256 Render the Act Unconstitutionally Vague and Overbroad?
A. Is the Act Unconstitutionally Overbroad Because it Raises the Statutory Age of Majority from 16 to 18?
Gottesman asserts that section 2256 4 of the Act--its definitional section--is facially unconstitutional because it renders the Act applicable to depictions of those under the age of 18, whereas the statute upheld in New York v. Ferber , 458 U.S. 747 , 102 S.Ct. 3348 , 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982), set the age of majority at 16.
See Ferber , 458 U.S. at 774 , 102 S.Ct. at 3363 (rejecting constitutional challenges to statute prohibiting promotion or distribution of sexual performances by children under the age of 16).
Gottesman argues that adding two years to the age of majority renders the Act unconstitutionally overbroad.
He contends that it is far more difficult to determine when a person is under 18 than it is to determine when he or she is under 16.
The result, according to Gottesman, is that distribution of sexually explicit material becomes such a hazardous profession that its practitioners will refuse to handle materials involving persons anywhere near the age of 18, thus restricting protected expression involving, for example, 23 or 25-year-olds.
The Supreme Court stated in Ferber that it would invalidate a statute for overbreadth "'only as a last resort.'
[T]he overbreadth involved [must] be 'substantial' before the statute involved will be invalidated on its face."
Ferber , 458 U.S. at 769 , 102 S.Ct. at 3361 (citation omitted).
Although Gottesman's argument is not without some force, we see no basis for concluding that any overbreadth here is sufficiently greater than that attending a 16-year age line to compel a different result.
Indeed, we would not lightly hold that the Constitution disables our society from protecting those members it has traditionally considered to be entitled to special protections--minors.
Gottesman merely quotes a district court case discussing the Act's raising of the age of majority from 16 to 18, United States v. Kantor , 677 F.Supp.
1421 (C.D.Cal.1987), vacated, mandate granted , United States v. United States District Court for the Central District of California , 858 F.2d 534 (9th Cir.1988), and a series of Supreme Court cases that permit "adult" treatment of 16 and 17-year-olds.
See, e.g. , Stanford v. Kentucky , 492 U.S. 361 , 109 S.Ct. 2969 , 106 L.Ed.2d 306 (1989) (permitting capital punishment for 16 and 17-year-olds).
With respect to the former, Kantor did state that the Act seemed overbroad, but it also refused to strike down the statute on its face, in light of Ferber .
With respect to the Supreme Court cases, they merely permit, rather than require, adult treatment of 16 and 17-year-olds.
Moreover, they indicate nothing about the substantiality (or lack thereof) of the overbreadth of section 2256 .
Thus, Gottesman's arguments are far from sufficient to overcome the presumption against invalidating a statute on its face for overbreadth.
B. Does Section 2256 Render the Act Unconstitutionally Overbroad or Vague Because it Substitutes "Lascivious" for "Lewd"?
Gottesman contends that section 2256 is overbroad and vague because Congress replaced "lewd" with "lascivious" in defining illegal exhibition of the genitals of children.
See 18 U.S.C. 2256(2)(E) .
In so arguing, he ignores United States v. Wiegand , 812 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir.), cert. denied , 484 U.S. 856 , 108 S.Ct. 164 , 98 L.Ed.2d 118 (1987), in which we rejected a similar argument, stating that "'[l]ascivious' is no different in its meaning than 'lewd,' a commonsensical term whose constitutionality was specifically upheld in Miller v. California [ 413 U.S. 15 , 93 S.Ct. 2607 , 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973)] and in Ferber ."
Wiegand , 812 F.2d at 1243 (citations omitted).
We adhere to the view expressed in Wiegand .
C. Does Section 2256 Render the Act Unconstitutionally Overbroad or Vague Because it Prohibits Actual or Simulated Bestiality and Sadistic or Masochistic Abuse?
Gottesman asserts that section 2256 is overbroad and vague because it includes among the covered acts, without further definition, actual or simulated bestiality and sadistic or masochistic abuse.
18 U.S.C. 2256(2) .
This argument was essentially answered in Ferber , which upheld the constitutionality of a similar statute.
The relevant section of the statute at issue in Ferber defined the prohibited sexual conduct as "'actual or simulated sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse, sexual bestiality, masturbation, sado-masochistic abuse, or lewd exhibition of the genitals.'"
458 U.S. at 751 , 102 S.Ct. at 3351 .
Gottesman focuses on three differences between section 2256 and the statute in Ferber : First, he argues that section 2256 's prohibition of "simulated" acts renders it overbroad and vague.
The statute in Ferber also prohibited "simulated" acts, however, and the structure of the sentence suggests that "simulated" modified all the acts on the list.
Thus, there is no meaningful distinction between section 2256 and the Ferber statute in this regard.
Second, Gottesman focuses on section 2256(2)(D) 's alleged inclusion of "sadistic or masochistic; abuse."
The semicolon before "abuse" is a typographical error in the unofficial code, however; the official version of section 2256(2)(D) states "sadistic or masochistic abuse."
Compare 18 U.S.C. 2256(2)(D) (1988) with 18 U.S.C.A. 2256(2)(D) (West Supp.1992).
The only difference between section 2256 and the Ferber statute, therefore, is the former's replacement of "sado-masochistic abuse" with "sadistic or masochistic abuse."
The two terms are indistinguishable.
The final difference that Gottesman cites is that the Ferber statute prohibited "sexual bestiality," whereas section 2256 refers only to "bestiality."
Gottesman suggests that, under section 2256 , "bestiality" could be read to encompass its entire dictionary definition, so that it would also prohibit, e.g., "the display, gratification, or an instance of bestial traits or impulses."
Webster's International Dictionary (3rd ed. 1966).
In context, however, such a reading would not be justified; "bestiality" is listed as a subcategory of "sexually explicit conduct."
The term can hardly be interpreted to mean "acting beastly"; properly construed, the term is no different from Ferber's "sexual bestiality."
Thus, we reject all of Gottesman's vagueness and overbreadth challenges to the Act.
II.
Does Section 2252 Render the Act Unconstitutional Because it Does Not Require Proof of Scienter that the Materials Distributed Are Child Pornography?
Gottesman's other facial challenge to the Act is that section 2252--the section prohibiting, inter alia , the distribution or receipt of child pornography--violates the guarantee of free speech under the First Amendment and the guarantee of due process under the Fifth Amendment because it does not require that the prosecution demonstrate the defendant's knowledge of the age of the performers.
Gottesman argues that: (1) section 2252 does not include a scienter requirement regarding the minority of the performers; and (2) the lack of a scienter requirement violates the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution.
A. What Showing of Scienter Does Section 2252 Require?
The main point of contention between the parties is over the scienter requirement of section 2252 .
Gottesman contends that section 2252 does not require knowledge of the minority of the performers, whereas the government argues that section 2252 requires knowledge of "the nature and character of the material."
The government's position is a bit cagey; it suggests at times that the statute requires that the distributor know that the material is child pornography, but argues that it does not require that the distributor know the age of the performers.
Of course, it would make no difference under any construction of the statute if the defendant did not know precisely whether the underage performer was age 6, 7 or 8.
What the government seems to be saying in its brief, however, is that the statute does not even require that the defendant know that one or more performers was under the age of 18, so long as he knew the general nature of the materials he was distributing.
We ruled on the question of the scienter required by the Act in Thomas , in which the defendant was accused of violating section 2252 .
Thomas, like Gottesman in the instant case, argued that section 2252 requires knowledge of the minority of the performer, and that, therefore, the indictment was insufficient because it failed to allege that Thomas knew that the pornography he transported depicted a minor.
After setting forth section 2252 , we stated that The section , therefore, does not require that Thomas knew that the pornography he transported, mailed, and received involved a minor.
The section requires only that Thomas knowingly transported and received the material 893 F.2d at 1070 (emphasis added).
Thus, Thomas held that section 2252 does not require knowledge that the material involves a minor.
In fact, Thomas indicates that section 2252 does not require any knowledge of the contents of the material; the only scienter requirement of section 2252 is the defendant's knowledge that he mailed the material.
The government does not attempt to distinguish Thomas , but rather relies on United States v. Moncini , 882 F.2d 401 (9th Cir.1989).
In Moncini , the defendant argued that section 2252 requires the government to prove that a defendant knew that mailing child pornography was illegal.
We rejected this argument, stating that "[s]ection 2252(a) requires that the government prove that the defendant had knowledge of the nature of the contents of the visual depictions and that the depictions were to be transported or shipped," but that no more was required.
Id. at 404 .
Thus, we held that section 2252 did not require knowledge of the illegality of mailing child pornography.
See also United States v. Brown , 862 F.2d 1033, 1036 (3rd Cir.1988) (under section 2252 "recipient need only know that the material he receives is child pornography").
The problem with the government's reliance on Moncini is that its statement that knowledge of the contents is required is dictum.
In Moncini , the question before us was whether section 2252 requires knowledge of the illegality of the mailings; the statement regarding knowledge of the contents was unnecessary to our ruling.
In Thomas , on the other hand, the defendant squarely raised the question of whether section 2252 requires knowledge that the performers are under the age of 18.
Our statement that section 2252 requires no such knowledge constituted part of our ruling.
Thus, Thomas is the only precedent from this circuit on the question of whether section 2252 requires scienter of the minority of the performers.
We are bound by its conclusion that section 2252 contains no such requirement.
B. What Level of Scienter Does the Constitution Require?
Gottesman contends--and the government does not dispute--that a statute prohibiting the distribution of printed or taped materials that does not require some knowledge of the contents of the material violates the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.
The Supreme Court so ruled in Smith v. California , 361 U.S. 147 , 80 S.Ct. 215 , 4 L.Ed.2d 205 (1959).
In Smith , the Court held that the First Amendment prohibits prosecution of a book distributor for possession of an obscene book unless the distributor has "knowledge of the contents of the book."
361 U.S. at 153 , 80 S.Ct. at 218 .
See Ferber , 458 U.S. at 765 , 102 S.Ct. at 3358 ("As with obscenity laws, criminal responsibility may not be imposed without some element of scienter on the part of the defendant.
"); see also Osborne v. Ohio , 495 U.S. 103, 115 , 110 S.Ct. 1691, 1699 , 109 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990) (noting "the requirement laid down in Ferber that prohibitions on child pornography include some element of scienter").
The Smith opinion did not delineate the level of scienter that the Constitution requires.
In Hamling v. United States , 418 U.S. 87 , 94 S.Ct. 2887 , 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974) and Ripplinger v. Collins , 868 F.2d 1043 (9th Cir.1989), however, the constitutional requirements were clarified somewhat.
In Hamling , a defendant convicted of distributing obscene material argued that the government was required to prove that he knew that the material was obscene.
The Supreme Court, in rejecting this argument, stated that: "It is constitutionally sufficient that the prosecution show that a defendant had knowledge of the contents of the materials he distributed, and that he knew the character and nature of the materials."
Hamling , 418 U.S. at 123 , 94 S.Ct. at 2910 .
We applied Hamling in Ripplinger , finding a statutory definition unconstitutional on its face because it did not require actual knowledge of the contents of the pornographic material.
In so ruling, we indicated that a statute must require knowledge of the character of the materials in order to pass constitutional muster.
Ripplinger , 868 F.2d at 1056 .
In purporting to apply these principles here, the government once again skates a very fine line in its brief.
It concedes that, to be constitutional, the statute must require knowledge of the nature and character of the material, and it sometimes formulates this requirement as knowledge that the material is "child pornography."
On the other hand, it appears to resist a requirement of proof that the defendant know that one or more performers were underage.
It emphasizes that the Constitution does not require knowledge by the defendant of the actual age of the underage performer.
Of course that must be true.
The question, however, is whether it requires knowledge that one or more performers was under age 18.
In at least part of its argument, the government seems to suggest that there is no such requirement: See also United States v. Thomas 893 F.2d 1066, 1070 section 2252(a) Government's brief, p. 17.
At oral argument, the government moved away somewhat from this perch and conceded that the statute would have severe constitutional problems if it did not include a requirement of knowledge that at least one performer engaged in the specified sexually explicit acts was under 18 years of age.
Whatever the government's position, we conclude that the constitutional minimum requirement of scienter for the Act's proscription of transporting or receiving child pornography is knowledge that at least one of the performers is under age 18.
It is true that, in Hamling , it was not necessary that the violator know that the material he was distributing was obscene.
But the Supreme Court's point was that it was not essential that the violator know the legal status of the materials; he could not "avoid prosecution by simply claiming that he had not brushed up on the law."
Hamling , 418 U.S. at 123 , 94 S.Ct. at 2911 .
The question before us does not concern the defendant's requisite knowledge of the law; it concerns his knowledge of a particular fact--the underage of the performer.
Our decision in United States v. United States District Court for the Central District of California , 858 F.2d 534 (9th Cir.1988), is highly instructive.
There we dealt with charges under section 2251(a) of the Act against producers of films also featuring the redoubtable Traci Lords; the issue was whether the producers were entitled to an affirmative defense that they were deceived by Lords into believing that she was an adult.
We held that the First Amendment required that provision for such a defense be engrafted onto the Act.
Id. at 538-44 .
We declined to hold, however, that the Constitution required knowledge of the minority of the performer to be an element of the offense.
Our reasons for so declining are most relevant here: See, e.g. Hamling 418 U.S. at 123 94 S.Ct. at 2910 see Smith 361 U.S. at 153-54 80 S.Ct. at 218-19 Id. at 543-44 n. 6.
These considerations concerning distributors or receivers are directly applicable here, and we find them compelling.
Section 2252 potentially applies to all kinds of recipients or distributors of videotapes and magazines.
To render them all prima facie criminals if one of the performers in a portrayal of sexually explicit conduct is underage, without the distributor's or recipient's knowledge, would be to create precisely the kind of chilling effect condemned by Smith .
That we cannot do consistently with the First Amendment as the Supreme Court has interpreted it.
We conclude, therefore, that the First Amendment mandates that a statute prohibiting the distribution, shipping or receipt of child pornography require knowledge of the minority of the performers as an element of the crime it defines.
Section 2252 , as authoritatively construed by Thomas , does not so require.
The question then arises whether, in the face of Thomas , we could construe section 2252 so as to save its constitutionality.
In District Court , we engrafted an affirmative defense onto section 2251(a) in order to save it.
Despite that example, we do not feel free to follow an analogous course here.
First, it comes closer to judicial rewriting of a statute to engraft onto it an element of the crime than it does to recognize an affirmative defense, of a type that often exists without being specified in the statute defining the crime.
See District Court , 858 F.2d at 542 .
Second, Thomas decided the precise question whether knowledge of the performer's underage was an element of 2252, and it cited District Court for the analogous proposition that scienter was not an element of section 2251 .
Thomas , then, was decided in full knowledge of District Court and its rationale.
Thomas nevertheless ruled squarely that scienter of the minority of the performer was not an element of the crime defined by section 2252 .
Not sitting as an en banc court, we regard ourselves as bound by Thomas 's interpretation.
CONCLUSION In summary, then, we conclude that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution mandates that a statute prohibiting the distribution, shipping or receipt of child pornography require as an element knowledge of the minority of at least one of the performers who engage in or portray the specified conduct.
Section 2252 , as authoritatively construed by Thomas , does not so require.
As a result, section 2252 is unconstitutional on its face.
Gottesman's conviction therefore cannot stand.
REVERSED.
