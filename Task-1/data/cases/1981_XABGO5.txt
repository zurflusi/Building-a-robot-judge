 JAMES C. HILL , Circuit Judge: Before a "new drug" may be introduced into interstate commerce it must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration's "new drug application" (NDA) process.
21 U.S.C. 355(a) .
Only drugs that are "new drugs" under 21 U.S.C. 321(p) require an NDA as a condition of marketing.
The NDA process is often expensive and time consuming.
In the district court, 498 F.Supp.
288 , the plaintiff-appellee, the United States, alleged that Generix was distributing "new drugs" without approved new drug applications.
The United States sought to enjoin this distribution pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 332 .
These appeals arise from an order granting in part and denying in part the United States' motion for a preliminary injunction and denying Generix's motion for rehearing and motion to amend order on preliminary injunction.
28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1) .
The issue in these appeals is whether the definition of "new drug" in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p) (West 1972) applies to the entire drug product or whether it applies only to a drug's active ingredients.
We hold that the language and intent of Congress limits the definition to a drug's active ingredients.
Accordingly, we vacate the preliminary injunction issued by the district court.
1 I. Definitions are important in this case. Appellant Generix distributes generic drugs.
A generic drug is a copy of the active ingredient of another manufacturer's drug product which as has been shown to be safe and effective.
2 A drug product is composed of an active ingredient, or incipient, which represents up to 10% of the product, and excipients, such as binders, coating, and capsules, which account for the remainder.
Because manufacturing techniques vary, generic drug products often combine an active ingredient that is generally recognized as safe and effective and excipients that are unique to the individual manufacturer.
The active ingredients of Generix's drug products were not generally in issue in the district court proceedings.
Rather, the government's experts testified that the variances in excipients due to different manufacturing processes can directly affect the bioavailability of the active ingredient.
Bioavailability is a measure of the time it takes for a given drug product to deliver the active ingredient to the particular organ or area.
Additionally, the differences in excipients can affect bioequivalence, a measure based on the comparison of one drug to another.
Drug products which are bioequivalent can be used interchangeably for the treatment of the same illness.
Both government experts stressed that the differences in bioavailability and bioequivalence between the product originally prepared using the proved safe and effective "pioneer drug" and the product later produced using the same drug with, perhaps, different binders, coatings, etc. may effect the safety and efficacy of the generic drug product.
This is especially true where the drug product involved is a sustained release drug.
Differing rates of solubility due to differences in excipients may cause "dumping" of the active ingredient into the bloodstream all at once.
In drugs where there is high toxicity, this may lead to an overdose.
In essence, the government argues that any difference between excipients renders a drug product a "new drug" within the meaning intended by the statute.
According to the government, whether the active ingredient is generally recognized as safe and effective is irrelevant to the discussion.
Therefore, the government concludes, Generix's products are "new drugs" due to differing excipients.
Generix argues that if the active ingredient is generally recognized as safe and effective, the new drug product is not a "new drug" despite differences in excipients.
After reviewing the statute and the case law the district court settled on the following legal standard: 21 U.S.C. 321(p) District Court Opinion at 292, quoting Premo Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Inc. v. United States , 475 F.Supp.
52, 55 (S.D.N.Y.1979), reversed 629 F.2d 795 (2d Cir. 1980).
The district court then concluded that the government's experts had raised a reasonable possibility that the safety and effectiveness of certain Generix drug products were suspect because of their excipients.
The court further concluded that Generix had not refuted the government's proof.
Accordingly, the district court enjoined Generix from distributing their products which contained allopurinal, spironolactone, furosemide, chlorothiazide with reserpine, amitriptyline, and diethylpropion hydrochloride.
District Court Order at 294.
The district court refused to enjoin the distribution of Generix products containing prochloreperazine meleate and chlorthalidone.
Id. II.
In determining whether or not the term "new drug" refers only to the active ingredient of a drug product, as distinguished from excipients, we turn first to the relevant statutes.
Title 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1) defines a "drug" as follows: 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1) .
The record shows that the drugs listed in the sources described in subsection (A) of 321(g)(1) are "drug substances."
not drug products.
More importantly, Title 21 U.S.C. 321(p) defines "new drug" as follows: 21 U.S.C. 321(p) .
Under subsection (2), after a period of time has elapsed and marketing experience has been acquired, a "new drug" substance will no longer be considered a "new drug" requiring an approved NDA to be marketed.
As the Supreme Court has noted: 21 U.S.C. 321(p)(2) Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott & Dunning, Inc. , 412 U.S. 609, 631 , 93 S.Ct. 2469, 2484 , 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973).
If "new drug" refers to the drug product as opposed to the active ingredient, a drug could never "muster the requisite scientifically reliable evidence of effectiveness" in order to "drop out of active regulation by ceasing to be a 'new drug.'"
This is so because the factors that bear on the safety and effectiveness of a specific product--manufacturing techniques, quality control, and the precise manner of formulating the finished dosage--are not part of the information made known to the medical community.
Indeed, as we are informed by counsel, a significant part of such information is a closely guarded trade secret that may not be revealed by the F.D.A.
See 21 U.S.C. 331(j) .
Specifically, FDA regulations prohibit public disclosure of certain information in a new drug application, including manufacturing methods and processes, quality control procedures and quantitative and semiquantitative formulas.
21 C.F.R. 314.14(g) .
In addition, only the identity of inactive ingredients previously disclosed may be released.
See 21 C.F.R. 321 (p)(2).
Accordingly, the "general recognition" test called for by 321(p) must apply to a drug product's active ingredient.
Otherwise, each new drug product would be considered a "new drug" and 321(p)(2) would be superfluous.
3 III.
In effect, the FDA's interpretation of the Act would create a product-by-product licensing system.
4 In addition to rendering the statutory language useless, such an interpretation is plainly contrary to the Congressional intent.
5 Congress did not deal extensively with the role of generic drugs when the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was initially enacted in 1938.
However, the House Report did state that "this [ section 505 , U.S.C. 355] is not a license provision, but is intended merely to prevent the premature marketing of new drugs not properly tested for safety."

Generic drugs played a central role in this legislation.
The legislation originated as the result of an investigation by the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly.

That Subcommittee was concerned with the large profit and tight market control of a few large companies in the drug industry.
The Subcommittee found that "one of the principal factors underlying this market control was the success of major drug companies in persuading physicians to prescribe drugs by the companies' trade names despite the existence of less expensive, chemically identical generic-named drugs."

Excipients are unique to each individual drug manufacturer.
Hence, if they are included within the definition of "new" drug no drug could ever obtain an "official" or "generic" name through general recognition as is contemplated by the above Congressional language.
6 IV.
In the 1962 Amendments to the Act, Congress provided the means to regulate the excipients in a drug product containing an approved generic drug without subjecting the drug product to the new drug approval process.
Specifically, the FDA may invoke the drug provisions of 21 U.S.C. 351 to insure that a drug is not "adulterated."
The FDA may find that a drug is adulterated (1) if there have been inadequate controls in its manufacture, 351(a); (2) if the strength, quality or purity differ from the official compendium, 351(b); if the strength of a drug is misrepresented, 351(c); or if a drug's mixture with another substance reduces "its quality or strength."
351(d).
Presumably the FDA could regulate bioavailability and bioequivalence through the provisions of 351.
As the Senate Report stated: Section 5 section 501(a)(2) sections 3 S.Rep.

V. The gist of the government's argument is that if drug products are not subject to the NDA process their safety and effectiveness can not be properly regulated as required by 21 U.S.C. 321(p) .
It may well be good public policy to regulate the bioavailability and bioequivalence through the NDA or some equivalent process.
However, we have found that the statutory language and history of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act does not require such approval.
The judicial branch may not legislate to fill perceived voids in public policy.
Our Constitution leaves that job to Congress.
See Wilson v. First Houston Investment Corp. , 566 F.2d 1235, 1243-45 (5th Cir. 1978) (Hill, J., dissenting) vacated in light of Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis , 444 U.S. 11 , 100 S.Ct. 242 , 62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979).
For example, scientific studies since 1962 might provide a strong argument that excipients should be included in the definition of "new drug."
Such a decision necessarily implicates complex chemical and pharmacological considerations.
The judicial branch is not equipped properly to assess such considerations.
In sum, we hold that Congress legislated that the term "new drug" as used in 321(p) applies only to the active ingredient of a drug product.
Accordingly, we vacate the preliminary injunction issued by the district court.
VACATED and REMANDED with instructions to DISMISS.
