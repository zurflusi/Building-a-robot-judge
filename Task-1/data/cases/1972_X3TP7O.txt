 PELL , Circuit Judge.
This appeal is from a dismissal by the district court of plaintiffs' amended complaint.
Plaintiffs brought this action under 42 U.S.C. 1981 , 1982 , 1983 and 1985 , seeking, in addition to damages, injunctive relief for claimed deprivations, under color of law, custom and usage of Cairo, and Alexander County, Illinois, of various rights and immunities secured to plaintiffs and members of their class under the Constitution of the United States and the above-named sections of Title 42 .
Jurisdiction was founded on 28 U.S.C. 1331 and 1343 .
This court, in reviewing the district court's dismissal of plaintiffs' amended complaint, must construe the amended complaint liberally and consider all of the factual allegations to be true, resolving any doubts in plaintiffs' favor.

We are not here concerned whether the plaintiffs will be able to adduce competent proof of their allegations.
Plaintiffs, in substance, charge that the defendants, functionaries of Alexander County, have systematically applied the state criminal laws so as to discriminate against plaintiffs and their class on the basis of race, interfering thereby with the free exercise of their constitutional rights.
The named plaintiffs, with two exceptions, are black citizens of Cairo.
The plaintiffs, allegedly financially poor persons, name as their class all other persons similarly situated, presumably as to race and poverty.
Defendant Berbling is the State's Attorney for Alexander County.
Defendant O'Shea at the time of the commencement of this suit was a Magistrate of the Circuit Court for Alexander County and on July 1, 1971, became an Associate Judge of Alexander County.
Defendant Spomer is an Associate Judge of the Circuit Court for Alexander County.
Defendant Shepherd is an investigator for defendant Berbling, but is not himself an Assistant State's Attorney.
As to each of the defendants, it is alleged that since the early 1960's, black citizens of Cairo have been actively seeking equal opportunity and treatment in such areas as employment, housing, education and ordinary day-to-day relations with white citizens and officials of Cairo.
One of the important manifestations of the equality quest is the participation by the plaintiffs and their encouragement of others to do likewise in an economic boycott of local merchants deemed to have engaged in racial discrimination.
The equality quest allegedly has generated and continues to generate substantial tension and antagonism from the white citizens and officials.
It appears that in addition to the boycott there were peaceful demonstrations.
We now turn to the allegations pertaining to particular defendants, treating such charges as true for the purpose of this appeal.
BERBLING CONDUCT Berbling engages in a pattern and practice of refusing to permit black citizens to give evidence of criminal conduct committed by white citizens against black citizens.
He refuses to initiate criminal proceedings against white citizens arising out of assaults and batteries committed by them against black citizens.
He refuses to proceed on black citizen complaints by information or complaint but submits such matters to a grand jury in those instances in which he permits complaints to be filed.
He interrogates the black citizens before the grand jury with the purposeful intent of depriving the black citizens of their right to present their evidence to the grand jury.
In some instances before the grand jury, he declines to interrogate the black complainants at all.
When white persons are prosecuted on the basis of complaints by plaintiffs, Berbling engages in a practice of inadequately prosecuting in order to lose the cases or to settle them on terms more favorable than those accorded black persons.
He engages in the practice of requesting or recommending greater bonds and sentences in cases involving black persons than those of white persons.
He engages in a practice of bringing significantly more serious charges against plaintiffs for conduct which would result in no charge or a minor charge against white persons.
All of the above alleged practices are assertedly carried on by Berbling "wilfully and maliciously with the intent (a) to deprive plaintiffs of the benefits of the criminal justice system, (b) to deprive plaintiffs of their right to give evidence against those who threaten their security, peace and tranquility and to deprive plaintiffs of their right to hold property to the same extent as is enjoyed by white citizens, and (c) to deter plaintiffs from engaging in a peaceful boycott and other activities protected by the First Amendment."
Specific instances of illustrative supporting conduct pertaining to named individual plaintiffs are set forth in the amended complaint.
SHEPHERD CONDUCT He engages in a pattern and practice of refusing to permit plaintiffs to give evidence against white persons respecting acts threatening the personal safety of plaintiffs.
The illustrative specific incident, however, is that Shepherd refused to permit one of the plaintiffs, because of her race, to file criminal charges against a white man who had kicked her in the stomach while she was peacefully demonstrating "against the racially discriminatory practices of merchants and public officials."
The example in the complaint seems questionably illustrative of the allegation with regard to the discriminatory pattern and practice and, in any event, there would seem to be some question of Shepherd's authority to decline to file criminal charges as he, as we understand it, was an investigator only.
SHEPHERD and BERBLING CONDUCT A conspiracy is charged against Berbling and Shepherd in that they engage in conduct that prevents plaintiffs because of their race from giving evidence against white persons respecting acts threatening plaintiffs' personal safety.
The illustrative example was the same incident alleged as to Shepherd individually except that here it is alleged that Shepherd, "at Berbling's direction, and because of her race, refused to allow" the filing of the complaint.
Questions existing here also arise from the specific illustration utilized.
SPOMER and O'SHEA CONDUCT Spomer and O'Shea, as judges, engage in a pattern and practice of discriminatory conduct based on race as follows: They set bond in criminal cases by following an unofficial bond schedule without regard to the facts of a case or circumstances of an individual defendant.
They sentence black persons to longer criminal terms and impose harsher conditions than they do for white persons who are charged with the same or equivalent conduct.
They require plaintiffs and members of their class, when charged with violations of city ordinances which carry fines and possible jail penalties, if the fine cannot be paid, to pay for a trial by jury.
1 We have attempted in the foregoing summary to provide a condensation of the principal allegations of a 21-page complaint.
We do not commend the amended complaint as a model of pleading but we also recognize that uncharted fields were being plowed.
Matters of which an entire community may be cognizant may well pose almost insuperable difficulties when the attempt is made to articulate these matters into the "short and plain statement" required by Rule 8 (a), Fed.R.Civ.P.
It has been said that in Civil Rights Act cases, highly specific factual averments are required to defeat a motion to dismiss, otherwise "every complaint against a State official by the simple expedient of averring conclusions would be cognizable in the federal courts under the Civil Rights Act."

Hoge v. Bolsinger , 211 F.Supp.
199, 201 (W.D.Pa.
1962), aff'd, 311 F.2d 215 (3rd Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 931 , 83 S.Ct. 878 , 9 L.Ed.2d 735 (1963).
Nevertheless, we recognize the underlying motivation of federal pleading to be to avoid the semantical donnybrooks inherent in differentiating what is evidence, ultimate facts and conclusions of law and fact.
See 5 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 1218 , at 133 et seq.
(1969).
We deem it preferable that dismissal should be sparingly used whenever it appears that a basis for federal jurisdiction in fact exists or may exist and can be stated by plaintiff.
Wright & Miller, supra , 1214 , at 107.
This, of course, does not provide a carte blanche for unlimited successive complaint amendments, and the ultimate duty of pleading his case rests upon the party and not upon the district court to divine what is not reasonably there.
The approach which we find should be applied here is aptly stated in Kamen Soap Products Co. v. Struthers Wells Corp. , 159 F.Supp.
706, 713 (S.D.N.Y.1958), as follows: See also Byrd v. Bates , 220 F.2d 480, 482 (5th Cir. 1955).
The appeal here is taken from the dismissal which the district court rested on two grounds, lack of jurisdiction and judicial immunity.
It is the propriety of this ruling which is all that is before us and which we now consider in the light of the applicable law.
We do not, as we have already indicated, venture any opinion as to whether the plaintiffs will be able to prove the concerted pattern of officially sponsored racial discrimination under color of law, custom and usage as here alleged.
2 LACK OF JURISDICTION The district court treated the case insofar as an injunction was sought as being an effort to have the federal court sit as a court of review over the acts and actions of duly elected county officials.
The court's memorandum and order states in part the following: The amended complaint primarily involves federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1343(3) and (4) 3 giving federal jurisdiction for deprivation of federally protected civil rights.
In our reading of the complaint, violations of these rights have been alleged.
The test for determining whether jurisdiction exists is set out in Bell v. Hood , 327 U.S. 678, 682-683 , 66 S.Ct. 773, 776 , 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946): The present case clearly fits the above language from Bell v. Hood, and we must, therefore, hold that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint for want of jurisdiction as the alleged constitutional and statutory violations do "form the sole basis for relief" and the action is not "so patently without merit as to justify" the court's dismissal.
JUDICIAL IMMUNITY In dismissing the case, while there was reference to want of jurisdiction, the district court's opinion stressed that the complaint sought to review matters of judicial discretion.
It would seem that the dismissal was, in reality, one for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, Rule 12(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P.
It is on that alternative theory for the district court's actions that we will proceed.
Defendants contend that as judicial and quasi-judicial officers they were not liable in civil suits at common law and that the various civil rights acts did nothing to change this rule.
Thus, we must first examine the legislative history of those acts to determine whether or not allegations such as those in the complaint before us were intended by Congress to be actionable.
Simply stated, that question raises to issue whether or not Congress, in passing these acts, intended to eliminate the doctrine of judicial immunity.
With that necessary background, we can then consider subsequent judicial decisions which have added substantial glosses to these statutes.
When Congress convened in December 1865, it faced a country that had been torn asunder by a great war.
Undoubtedly to many members of Congress there was a clear threat that one reason for fighting the war, freedom and equality for blacks, might be lost.
The first reaction of the South to defeat and emancipation had been shock and "a simultaneous withdrawal of both races from the enforced intimacy and the more burdensome obligations imposed by the old regime on each [race]."
4 However, this reaction was shortlived: 5 When Senator Trumbull of Illinois, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, introduced S. 61 on January 5, 1866, it was with the view that strong legislation was necessary.
This bill, which was to become the Civil Rights Act of 1866, sought to eliminate both state laws and private conduct which discriminated on the basis of race.
In introducing the bill, Senator Trumbull "described its objectives in terms that belie any attempt to read it narrowly."
Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. , 392 U.S. 409, 431 , 88 S.Ct. 2186, 2199 , 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968).
6 Title 42 U.S.C. 1981 and 1982 derive from the Civil Rights Act of April 9, 1866, ch.
31, 1 , 14 Stat. 27 .
7 "In the House, as in the Senate, much was said about eliminating the infamous Black Codes.
But, like the Senate, the House was moved by a larger objective--that of giving real content to the freedom guaranteed by the Thirteenth Amendment."
Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. , supra , 392 U.S. at 433 , 88 S.Ct. at 2200 .
In essence, what 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 intended was to eliminate those badges and indicia of slavery which were still a part of both Southern law and custom.
In re Civil Rights Cases , 109 U.S. 3 , 3 S.Ct. 18 , 27 L.Ed. 835 (1883).
But, not until Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. , supra , did the Supreme Court agree that Congress meant what it said in 42 U.S.C. 1982 , which by its own terms encompassed all racially motivated refusals to rent or sell without being limited to those acts sanctioned by the state, "under color of State law."
For the present case, the more important aspect of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was 2 , which became Title 18 U.S.C. 242 .
8 As originally enacted this section provided, 2 And be it further enacted The plain words of the statute would seem to include "any person," even prosecutors and judges, and this was the subject of extensive debate.
When the bill was first being introduced, Senator Trumbull hesitated to say that it would reach conduct of judges.
9 However, as the debate moved on, Senator Stewart noted that the fugitive slave laws had done exactly what the opponents of the bill complained of, made criminal all actions by persons to effectuate state laws which Congress had determined to overthrow.
10 The issue was clearly drawn in President Johnson's veto message on March 27, 1866, 11 where he gave as a major objection to 2 of the bill that it would make legislators and judges criminally liable.
The veto was overridden.
In these final debates, Senator Trumbull, the bill's sponsor and principal advocate, stated, 12 It is significant to note in these debates that the acts of a legislator were viewed as probably not falling within the prohibition since the legislator himself in voting for a bill was not actually denying anyone his civil rights.
To further clarify the applicability of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to just the sort of facts we have before us, we need only note the remarks of Congressman Lawrence who, in commenting on combinations of white persons organized to drive freedmen out of various communities, stated, "If States should undertake to authorize such offenses, or deny to a class of citizens all protection against them, we may then inquire whether the nation itself may be destroyed by this insidious means."
13 It appears to us that in 1866, in considering criminal sanctions, Congress clearly had decided to eliminate judicial immunity at least for racially motivated intentional deprivations of civil rights .
In 1870, after ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress decided to reenact some of the previously enacted provisions of the 1866 Act, probably with the view that if they were too broad to be constitutional under the Thirteenth Amendment they would be valid under the Fourteenth.
14 Thus, as noted above, 18 U.S.C. 242 was reenacted and amended, as was 42 U.S.C. 1981 .
Once again, the legislative history of the bill shows that Congress intended to cover a wide field, specifically enacting the predecessor to 18 U.S.C. 241 which covered private conspiracies to deprive individuals of civil rights.
Perhaps the most informative statements were those by Senator Pool of North Carolina in support of Sections 5 , 6 and 7 of the Enforcement Act of 1870: but to say that it shall not deny to any person the equal protection of the law it seems to me opens up a different branch of the subject.
It shall not deny by acts of omission, by a failure to prevent its own citizens from depriving by force any of their fellow-citizens of these rights There is no legislation that could reach a State to prevent its passing a law.
It can only reach the individual citizens of the State in the enforcement of law 15 As the Supreme Court stated relative to the scope of 241 , "despite subsequent statements to the contrary, nothing in the records of the congressional debates or the Joint Committee on Reconstruction indicates any uncertainty that its objective was the protection of civil rights."
United States v. Price , 383 U.S. 787, 801 n. 9, 86 S.Ct. 1152, 1160 , 16 L.Ed.2d 267 (1966).
Admittedly, the crucial sections for plaintiffs--that is, the ones most central to their complaint--are 42 U.S.C. 1983 and 1985(3) .
But, in discussing their legislative history to determine congressional intent, it is clearly relevant to consider the above discussion of 18 U.S.C. 241 , 242 , as they are the criminal analogues to the civil remedies provided in 1983 , 1985(3) .
In fact, the Supreme Court in determining how the phrase "under color of" should be interpreted stated, "Thus, it is beyond doubt that this phrase should be accorded the same construction in both statutes--in 1979 [now 42 U.S.C. 1983 ] and in 18 U.S.C. 242 ."
Monroe v. Pape , 365 U.S. 167, 185 , 81 S.Ct. 473, 483 , 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961).
So in deciding what Congress meant when it referred to "[e]very person" in 42 U.S.C. 1983 , it is significant that Congress had earlier rejected specifically absolute judicial immunity by passing the Civil Rights Act of 1866.
As to the congressional debates surrounding the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 20, 1871, ch.
22, 17 Stat. 13 , 16 the very title of the bill reflects one of the main concerns that Congress had.
On March 23, 1871, President Grant sent the following message to Congress: 17 The debates are replete with references both to private conspiracies and to inaction by state officials to curtail such activity.
18 As Mr. Justice Douglas said in Monroe v. Pape , 365 U.S. 167, 174-175 , 81 S.Ct. 473, 477 , 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), "[An] aim was to provide a federal remedy where the state remedy, though adequate in theory, was not available in practice .
.
.
.
It was not the unavailability of state remedies but the failure of certain States to enforce the laws with an equal hand that furnished the powerful momentum behind this 'force bill.'"
Thus, it should be noted that while the primary evil sought to be checked was the Ku Klux Klan, 42 U.S.C. 1983 applies not to Klan members but to those who, acting for the state, refuse or do not attempt to enforce state laws to protect all citizens.
That the state laws themselves might appear on their face to be nondiscriminatory and yet be applied to protect only certain classes of citizens was stressed in the debates.
19 Nowhere is the present case more clearly shown to be encompassed by exactly the type of discrimination sought to be remedied by the Ku Klux Klan Act than in the statement of Senator Pratt of Indiana relating to discrimination against Negroes and Union sympathizers in enforcing criminal laws: 20 21 Although Congress did substantially weaken 2 of the bill (the predecessor of 42 U.S.C. 1985(3) ) which had sought to federalize virtually all state criminal laws, the intent of 1 of the bill was and remained, at least in part, to hold liable those whose inaction caused or allowed to increase such criminal activity against given classes of citizens, since Congress was quite clear that such action constituted a deprivation of equal protection under the law which is a "deprivation of .
.
.
rights .
.
.
secured by the Constitution."
22 One further aspect of legislative history must be noted.
In discussing the scope of the coverage of the Ku Klux Klan Act, Mr.
Hoar stated that it would only interfere where "evils have attained such a degree as amounts to the destruction, to the overthrow, to the denial to large classes of the people of the blessing of the republican government altogether."
23 Although this gloss has not been closely followed in many cases, e. g. , Monroe v. Pape , supra , the fact that a situation of this nature exists, as alleged in the present complaint, would certainly seem to increase the logic of applying the statute as it is written, and not unduly narrowing it.
As the Supreme Court has recently stated, Mitchum v. Foster 407 U.S. 225, 242 92 S.Ct. 2151, 2162 32 L.Ed.2d 705 In sum, ignoring for the time being the issue of immunity, it is clear that the complaint does state a cause of action against the judges under 42 U.S.C. 1981 , 1983 (and perhaps under 42 U.S.C. 1982 ) since the judges are alleged to have imposed heavier fines and sentences and higher bails on plaintiffs' class than on the white citizens of Cairo.
As against Berbling and Shepherd, it would appear that a violation of 42 U.S.C. 1983 has been alleged in that they have denied to various plaintiffs equal access to the criminal justice system.
24 Further, it is clear that the failure to do one's duty is actionable under the statute as passed by Congress.
Thus, criminal liability can attach from such a failure as in United States v. Classic , 313 U.S. 299 , 61 S.Ct. 1031 , 85 L.Ed. 1368 (1941).
25 Finally, the fact that 42 U.S.C. 1981 does not itself contain a remedy is no objection.
In a similar situation the Supreme Court stated, "[t]he fact that 42 U.S.C. 1982 is couched in declaratory terms and provides no explicit method of enforcement does not, of course, prevent a federal court from fashioning an effective equitable remedy."
Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. , supra , 392 U.S. at 414 n. 13, 88 S.Ct. at 2190 .
And more recently, it was held that "[t]he existence of a statutory right implies the existence of all necessary and appropriate remedies.
See Texas & N.O.R.
Co. v. [Brotherhood of] Railway [& S. S.] Clerks , 281 U.S. 548, 569-570 [, 50 S.Ct. 427 , 74 L.Ed. 1034 ]."
Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc. , 396 U.S. 229, 239 , 90 S.Ct. 400, 405 , 24 L.Ed.2d 386 (1969).
This approach is not particularly new in federal jurisprudence.
In one of the earliest and most frequently cited opinions of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Marshall phrased the inquiry in the following terms: Marbury v. Madison 1 Cranch (5 U.S.) 137, 162-163 2 L.Ed. 60 Having determined, in the light of the relevant statutory and case history, that on its face the complaint states a cause of action, we must consider whether defendants' alleged immunity necessarily bars the relief sought.
Clearly, the statutes themselves are silent on the issue of immunity save for the fact that the term "every person" is used.
The legislative history presents a strong case for finding that most immunities were meant to be swept away, at least for intentional deprivation of a class's rights.
Yet, the plain words of the various Civil Rights Acts have not always fared well in the courts.
As the Northern ardor for further congressional legislative protection of the rights of Negroes dimmed and was virtually extinguished in 1877, 26 so did the courts follow a similar pattern.
In the In re Civil Rights Cases , 109 U.S. 3 , 3 S.Ct. 18 , 27 L.Ed. 835 (1883), the Supreme Court invalidated the 1st and 2nd Sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 which dealt with discrimination in public accommodations.
The Court held that the Thirteenth Amendment related solely to badges and incidents of slavery, 27 that the Fourteenth Amendment required state action, and that private discrimination in accommodations fell within neither category.
28 Thus, it has been only recently that the Court has decided in handling the various Reconstruction civil rights statutes to "'accord [them] a sweep as broad as [their] language.'
United States v. Price , 383 U.S. 787, 801 , [ 86 S.Ct. 1152 , 16 L.Ed.2d 267 ]; Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. , 392 U.S. 409, 437 [, 88 S.Ct. 2186 , 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 ]."
Griffin v. Breckenridge , 403 U.S. 88, 97 , 91 S.Ct. 1790, 1796 , 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971).
Turning to judicial immunity from suit, one of the first major cases is Bradley v. Fisher , 80 U.S. 335 , 13 Wall. 335 , 20 L.Ed. 646 (1871).
29 The Court held that the judge was immune from suit as long as he had jurisdiction of the subject matter, no matter how irregular his actions might have been, nor how malicious or corrupt his motives might be.
Such immunity was deemed essential to preserve the independence of the judiciary.
30 But Bradley , although one of the earliest cases in which the Court approved of judicial immunity, was a common law action, not a case arising under any of the civil rights acts.
Thus, it did not answer the question whether those acts had abolished such common law immunity.
The first case in that category was Ex parte Virginia , 100 U.S. 339 , 25 L.Ed. 676 (1879).
There, a judge of a Virginia county court was indicted under the predecessor of 18 U.S.C. 243 for excluding from the grand and petit jury lists black citizens who were otherwise qualified.
The petition for habeas corpus was filed on behalf of the judge to determine if the district court below had jurisdiction or any authority to act--essentially a test of the validity of the statute.
After holding that Congress had power under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to enact such a law, the Court faced the petitioner's claim that he was immune since he was acting in the performance of a judicial act.
The Court rejected the contention holding that the acts charged were not judicial, but merely ministerial.
31 However, in what may be regarded as an alternate ground for the holding, the Court went on to add, 100 U.S. at 348-349 25 L.Ed. 676 Thus, it would appear a judge can be held criminally liable for ministerial actions or actions "not within the limits of his discretion."
One of the few cases to hold a judicial officer liable for damages was Picking v. Pennsylvania R. Co. , 151 F.2d 240 (3rd Cir. 1945).
There the district court had dismissed the complaint against a variety of defendants, including Keiffer, a justice of the peace.
Plaintiffs alleged that when they were illegally arrested they sought to obtain their release at a hearing before Keiffer but that Keiffer refused to hold any hearing as he was required to do by law. 151 F.2d at 250 But the court there also considered the immunity issue.
After acknowledging the absolute judicial immunity which was the rule at common law, Judge Biggs stated, Section 1 R. S. Section 1979 Id. at 250 We note that defendants in the case before us do not contend that Congress did not have the power to eliminate judicial immunity, but only that it did not in fact do so. A few years after the Picking decision, the Supreme Court for the first time passed on the general scope of these sections of the 1871 Act.
In Tenney v. Brandhove , 341 U.S. 367 , 71 S.Ct. 783 , 95 L.Ed. 1019 (1951), a member of the California legislature was being sued for statements and acts performed as chairman of a Senate committee.
The Court held that Congress could not have meant to go so far as to eliminate legislative immunity: "The limits of 1 and 2 of the 1871 statute--now 43 and 47(3) of Title 8--were not spelled out in debate.
We cannot believe that Congress--itself a staunch advocate of legislative freedom--would impinge on a tradition so well grounded in history and reason by covert inclusion in the general language before us."
341 U.S. at 376 , 71 S.Ct. at 788 .
Interestingly enough, the Court did not refer to the legislative history of the previous Civil Rights Acts, where, as noted above, the liability of state legislators had been discussed and specifically excluded.
In 1966, in Bauers v. Heisel , 361 F.2d 581 (3rd Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1021 , 87 S.Ct. 1367 , 18 L.Ed.2d 457 (1967), the Third Circuit, sitting en banc, overruled Picking v. Pennsylvania R. Co. , supra , relying in part on Tenney , in part on one of the most complete compilation of cases ever made in this area, 32 and in part on its own reassessment of the policy involved.
This brought it into conformity with the rule in this Circuit which has held judges immune from damage suits for acts they did in discharge of their official duties, e. g. , Peckham v. Scanlon , 241 F.2d 761 (7th Cir. 1957); Stift v. Lynch , 267 F.2d 237 (7th Cir. 1959).
33 The issue was finally put to rest by the Supreme Court in Pierson v. Ray , 386 U.S. 547 , 87 S.Ct. 1213 , 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967), a crucial case, although not cited by defendants.
There a state court judge was sued for damages under 42 U.S.C. 1983 for his adjudging certain civil rights demonstrators "guilty when their cases came before his court."
34 After discussing the importance of judicial immunity as developed in Bradley v. Fisher , supra , the Court applied the Tenney v. Brandhove type of analysis to the situation, finding no specific intent of Congress to abrogate the doctrine. 35 Thus, the Court rejected the position propounded by Mr. Justice Douglas in his dissent that "[t]o most, 'every person' would mean every person , not every person except judges."
Pierson v. Ray , 336 U.S. at 559 , 87 S.Ct. at 1220 (Douglas, J., dissenting).
(Emphasis in original.)
But this, of course, does no more than show why plaintiffs in their complaint did not choose to sue the judge-defendants for money damages.
The grant of certiorari in Pierson was "to consider whether a local judge is liable for damages under 1983 for an unconstitutional conviction.
.
.
."
Id. at 551 , 87 S.Ct. at 1216 .
The Court did not consider the issue of immunity from injunctive or other equitable relief.
Nor do either of the cases cited by the district court in its memorandum and order in the case before us 36 hold that the sort of relief requested by plaintiffs herein is barred.
The issue of whether or not injunctive relief may be granted under 42 U.S.C. 1983 in an action against a state judge has been considered by only a few courts.
Significantly, in all the cases we have been able to find in which the court seriously considered this question, the gravamen of the offense was a discrimination by state judicial officers against a cognizable class--exactly the case alleged herein.
In United States v. Clark , 249 F.Supp.
720 (S.D.Ala.1965), a three-judge court was faced with a claim for injunctive relief against attempts by local officials to interfere with the rights of Negroes to use public accommodations and to register to vote.
The United States was the plaintiff pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1971 , 2000a-(a) , 2000a-5 , seeking a decree which requested in part an injunction to prevent defendants from 249 F.Supp.
at 722 The various judicial and quasi-judicial defendants--two judges and the city solicitor--objected on the ground that they were immune from suit.
After noting the importance of the doctrine of judicial immunity, the court went on to distinguish it: However, such a doctrine of judicial immunity applies only when those officials are faced with civil suits for damages in connection with the performance of their official duties Cooper v. Aaron 358 U.S. 1 78 S.Ct. 1401 3 L.Ed.2d 5 Lucas v. Forty-Fourth General Assembly of State of Colorado 377 U.S. 713 84 S.Ct. 1459 12 L.Ed.2d 632 Sterling v. Constantin 287 U.S. 378 53 S.Ct. 190 77 L.Ed. 375 Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board 187 F.Supp.
42 365 U.S. 569 81 S.Ct. 754 5 L.Ed.2d 806 In re Wallace 170 F.Supp.
63 Ex parte Young 209 U.S. 123, 159 28 S.Ct. 441 52 L.Ed. 714 249 F.Supp.
at 727-728 37 In a similar case involving intimidation of Negro citizens who wished to vote, Judge Wisdom, confronting the same sort of problem, drew the distinction between injunctive relief and damages: Pierson v. Ray 386 U.S. 547 87 S.Ct. 1213 18 L.Ed.2d 288 damages 42 U.S.C. 1983 United States v. McLeod 385 F.2d 734, 738 See also Phillips v. Cole , 298 F.Supp.
1049 (N.D.Miss.1968), and Bramlett v. Peterson , 307 F.Supp.
1311 (M.D.Fla.1969).
38 In sum, those courts which have considered the issue have held that when a class-discrimination is alleged, judicial officers may be enjoined.
39 Nor is there any statutory block to such an injunction.
Even if what plaintiffs request might fall within the rubric of 28 U.S.C. 2283 , which we doubt since they are not asking that any state court proceedings be "stayed," it is now clear that 42 U.S.C. 1983 is a specific statutory exemption to the prohibition.
Mitchum v. Foster , supra .
Mitchum also reaffirmed the teaching of Younger v. Harris , 401 U.S. 37 , 91 S.Ct. 746 , 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), as to the notions of comity and desire not to enjoin state court criminal prosecutions.
Although not raised by defendents we feel a few comments are merited.
Here there is a distinct allegation that plaintiffs are being subjected to unequal treatment by the judges because of their race and their civil rights activity.
This is an existing, present violation of 42 U.S.C. 1981 , not just a potential violation.
Moreover, plaintiffs have not sought to enjoin the state from prosecuting anyone, but merely to enjoin the judges from unconstitutionally fixing bail and sentences.
Finally, one important consideration with respect to the irreparable injury suffered by plaintiffs' class in sentencing discrimination, the individual defendant in a criminal case finds it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to obtain review of his sentence as long as it is within the statutory limits.
The standard of proof for abuse is very severe.
"[I]mposition of sentence is a matter of judicial discretion, and in the absence of a manifest abuse of that discretion it will not be altered by a reviewing court."
People v. Bonner , 37 Ill.2d 553, 563 , 229 N.E.2d 527, 533 (1967), cert. denied, 392 U.S. 910 , 88 S.Ct. 2067 , 20 L.Ed.2d 1368 (1968).
But it is quite possible that a class of plaintiffs will be able to show an invidious discrimination in length of sentences imposed by a given judge, even though all of the sentences may fall within the statutory maximum.
Although admittedly a difficult proposition for the plaintiffs to prove, we do not feel that proof is so improbable that the plaintiffs should be denied a chance to establish their allegations.
40 For the reasons expressed above, we consider that Younger does not control this sort of case, and if it does that the plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient to come within the "exceptional circumstances" test outlined therein: 401 U.S., at 46 91 S.Ct. 746 401 U.S., at 53 91 S.Ct. 746 401 U.S., at 54 91 S.Ct. 746 Mitchum v. Foster supra 407 U.S. at 230 92 S.Ct. at 2156 Since the immunity, often characterized as "quasi-judicial," cloaking the prosecuting attorney is, of necessity, derivative from the concepts developed in connection with the judiciary, the conclusions we have reached in the parent would seem to be dispositive of the offspring.
Nevertheless, because of cases treating the matter from the viewpoint of the prosecuting attorney, we do separately address ourselves to that phase of the present case. An early mention of "quasi-judicial" immunity is found in Yaselli v. Goff , 12 F.2d 396 (2nd Cir. 1926), aff'd per curiam (mem.), 275 U.S. 503 , 48 S.Ct. 155 , 72 L.Ed. 395 (1927), an action brought against a special assistant to the Attorney General for malicious prosecution.
The court chose to extend the immunity offered to judicial officers in the exercise of their duties to these quasi-judicial officers.
41 Cases from this Circuit have uniformly held that an action for damages would not lie against a prosecutor who was performing his duties, no matter what malice was alleged.
The earliest case in this Circuit considering the question is Cawley v. Warren , 216 F.2d 74 (7th Cir. 1954), in which plaintiff sued the state's attorney, his first assistant, and the foreman of a grand jury for allegedly wrongfully procuring indictments against him.
The action was brought under 42 U.S.C. 1985 , and the court, without reference to the legislative history, or even any reference to the words of the statute, stated, "[t]he law supports this claim of immunity.
It extends to and includes judges, prosecuting attorneys and members of a grand jury."
216 F.2d at 75 .
42 As noted in the first portion of this opinion, the legislative history of the various Civil Rights Acts makes a strong case for the view that Congress intended to hold prosecutors liable, even for damages, when they discriminated against classes of citizens.
Be that as it may, this court has followed its opinion in Cawley in numerous other cases, e. g. , Stift v. Lynch , 267 F.2d 237 (7th Cir. 1959), and Phillips v. Nash , 311 F.2d 513 (7th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 374 U.S. 809 , 83 S.Ct. 1700 , 10 L.Ed.2d 1033 (1963) (a case which followed shortly after the Supreme Court had opened up the field of damage suits for deprivation of civil rights by reversing this Circuit in Monroe v. Pape , supra ).
Nor is this Circuit the only one to adopt such a rule.
In fact every circuit which has considered the question seems to have reached the same result.
43 In many of these cases the court reached this result in a summary manner.
Our discussion of the relevant legislative history and the words of the statute themselves reflect our belief that there is not freedom from doubt on this issue.
However, the Supreme Court's opinion in Pierson v. Ray , supra , must control.
In essence, it seems that prosecutors are closer to the judge in Pierson than to the policeman in Monroe v. Pape , supra .
We therefore hold that insofar as defendant Berbling was acting within his prosecutorial function he has a quasi-judicial immunity from suit for damages under the Civil Rights Acts.
Two more issues remain with respect to Berbling and Shepherd: first, the scope of this quasi-judicial immunity, and, second, the availability of injunctive relief.
Insofar as Berbling and Shepherd are not acting within the scope of prosecutorial discretion they are not covered by the above cases absolving them from liability for damages.
The duties of the State's attorney are set out in the Illinois Revised Statutes, ch.
14, 5 (1971).
44 They include: Nowhere is there any mention of the State's attorney having as one of his "quasi-judicial" duties the investigation of crimes, which is primarily a police function.
It has long been established that police officers have no immunity from civil liability under 42 U.S.C. 1983 , Monroe v. Pape , supra .
It would be anomalous if the State's attorney's quasi-judicial immunity carried over to situations in which he was acting as a police investigator rather than in his quasi-judicial role.
45 Two other circuits have considered this issue and have reached the same result.
In Lewis v. Brautigam , 227 F.2d 124 (5th Cir. 1955), the state's attorney was alleged to have ordered deputies to force plaintiff to pose for photographs showing him in convict garb at a state prison and also to plead guilty.
The court found it unnecessary to inquire into the "nature of the quasi-judicial immunity further than to say that a quasi-judicial officer, such as a prosecuting attorney, who acts outside the scope of his jurisdiction and without authorization of law, cannot shelter himself from liability by the plea that he is acting under color of office."
227 F.2d at 129 .
Similarly in Robichaud v. Ronan , 351 F.2d 533 (9th Cir. 1965), plaintiff alleged that the county attorney had directed certain police activity designed to coerce and intimidate her into making a confession.
The court reversed the dismissal with some words that we find applicable to the present case: 351 F.2d at 536, 537-538 The court did not attempt to distinguish which acts might have been committed after the county attorney had abandoned his quasi-judicial role, but remanded to the district court to make such a determination.
In the case before us, the allegations in the complaint may not be sufficiently removed from judicial (or quasi-judicial) activity, such as evaluation for prosecutorial purposes, to warrant removing the cloak of immunity from them, but this was not considered by the district court.
The better course therefore is to remand to allow plaintiffs to clarify their complaint by amendment and give the district court a chance to reconsider in the light of the views expressed herein.
The second unanswered question is whether the State's attorney is subject to injunctive proscription.
Since Ex parte Young , 209 U.S. 123 , 28 S.Ct. 441 , 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), it has been clear that a federal court has the power to enjoin a state prosecutor from instituting criminal proceedings under a state statute.
Even earlier than Young , lower courts had recognized that such a power existed.
M. Schandler Bottling Co. v. Welch , 42 F. 561 (C.C.Kan.1890).
Moreover, in Mitchum v. Foster , supra , the Supreme Court has recently affirmed that 42 U.S.C. 1983 is an express statutory exception to 28 U.S.C. 2283 .
In light of the above cases, we come to the case of Arensman v. Brown , 430 F.2d 190 (7th Cir. 1970), in which the court held that quasi-judicial immunity forbids a request for an injunction against a prosecutor from prosecuting a criminal cause of action against the plaintiff.
We read Arensman as being confined to its facts, noting that the court stated "we think the case borders on the frivolous," 430 F.2d at 191 .
Also there was no allegation that plaintiff's rights could not be adequately vindicated at a criminal proceeding nor any other allegation that might exclude it from the guidelines set down in Younger v. Harris , supra .
We hold that the quasi-judicial immunity does not extend to complete freedom from injunction.
Although defendants did not raise the issue in their brief, we find it necessary to treat the consideration raised in Peek v. Mitchell , 419 F.2d 575 (6th Cir. 1970), where the court denied a similar affirmative injunction to require prosecution.
That case highlights the difference between an injunction forbidding prosecution and one compelling prosecution, which are admittedly based on different considerations.
In Peek , plaintiffs sought to compel federal and state officials to prosecute two Detroit policemen who allegedly committed violations of plaintiffs' civil rights during the Poor People's Campaign on May 13, 1968.
Initially the court rejected the contention that defendants had a total immunity from injunction, but added, 419 F.2d at 578 In denying injunctive relief, the court rejected the plaintiffs' contention that there was a "'systematic pattern' of conduct," and held We find no arbitrary or discriminatory action which would prompt substitution of our judgment for his 419 F.2d at 578-579 Similarly, it was recently stated, "It is hardly necessary to add that the doctrine of prosecutorial discretion has never insulated conduct from review on charges of bad faith, fraud, or illegality."
Boyd v. United States , 345 F.Supp.
790, 793 (E.D.N.Y.1972).
Plaintiffs in the present case have alleged that prerequisite for injunctive relief which the Sixth Circuit in Peek found lacking.
Plaintiffs have alleged that the State's attorney handles complaints and prosecutes cases in a blatantly discriminatory and arbitrary manner.
46 This is not a case in which it can be said that there is an adequate remedy at law and therefore there is no proper basis for equitable relief.
Theoretically, plaintiffs now have an action for damages under 42 U.S.C. 1985(3) against the private parties who have been assaulting them. 47 We, however, would retund credulity to say that a private action of that sort is the equivalent of prompt and effective prosecution under the criminal laws.
At least one of the principal reasons for criminal laws is their deterrent effect on similar conduct by others.
While, in some instances, the private damage action may have deterring effects, it seems unlikely it will obviate the necessity for a system of criminal justice.
The type of discriminatory conduct here alleged will not be, in our opinion, deterred by the possibility of piecemeal after-the-fact damage suits.
We conclude that plaintiffs' remedy at law is plainly inadequate and equitable relief is proper.
In addition, the above consideration shows the "great and immediate" irreparable injury being suffered by plaintiffs to justify intervention under Younger v. Harris , supra , 401 U.S. at 46 , 91 S.Ct. 746 .
As to defendants' repeated references to the fact that we are dealing with an area of discretion, we need only note the words of Chief Justice Marshall: duty Osborn v. Bank of the United States, et al.
9 Wheat.
(22 U.S.) 738, 866 6 L.Ed. 204 The word discretion is limited by the duty to follow the law and such a blanket pattern of discrimination as is here alleged cannot be said to conform to such a duty.
A discretionary action is subject to review and reversal for abuse of discretion.
"And by abuse of discretion is meant action which is arbitrary, fanciful, or clearly unreasonable."
United States v. McWilliams , 82 U.S.App.D.C.
259 , 163 F.2d 695, 697 (1947).
For us to find that the acts and failures to act alleged in the complaint do not constitute an abuse of discretion, we would have to say that they do not constitute "arbitrary action," Burns v. United States , 287 U.S. 216, 223 , 53 S.Ct. 154 , 77 L.Ed. 266 (1932), and this we can only do by ignoring the mandates of equal protection of the laws.
The principal reasons presented for various types of immunity have been capably summarized: 66 Harv.L.Rev.
1285 Numbers (1), (2) and (4) would seem to apply only to civil actions for damages and not to injunctive relief which we have approved herein.
Reason number (3) is a serious consideration--a prosecutor's time is necessarily limited--but since we approve not a case brought by a single disappointed complainant, but rather one brought by an entire class of citizens of Cairo, Illinois, the number of such suits charging discrimination against classes of citizens is not predictably substantial nor is their merit predictably insubstantial.
Moreover, as to both (3) and (5) the duty owed to, the public is primary and that duty is an even-handed, nondiscriminatory enforcement of the laws, not a vindication of an individual's complaint; it is that public duty which plaintiffs seek to enforce.
Finally, as to (6), defendants have not argued, either before this court or in the district court, that there is a requirement of exhaustion of state legal or political remedies, an argument which we would reject in the light of Carter v. Stanton , 405 U.S. 669 , 92 S.Ct. 1232 , 31 L.Ed.2d 569 (1972), no matter how potentially adequate those remedies might appear to be.
Nor could we find such political remedies adequate.
Cairo, Illinois, has admittedly been the scene of substantial civil rights agitation for the last several years.
Not surprisingly there has been a polarization of the community, and, in such a case, it would be totally presumptuous of this court to find that the ballot provides even a probability of remedying the alleged oppression of the minority by the duly elected representatives of the majority.
It was, in fact, just such oppression which caused the Congress to enact the provisions with which we now deal.
48 In summary, considering all of the generally accepted reasons for granting immunity to state officials, we conclude that none is applicable here, especially in light of the corrosive impact the alleged conduct has had on the equal handed application of the criminal justice system.
Nor do we find various alternative remedies sufficiently useful for us to deny the relief sought by plaintiffs.
As to any direct remedy by criminal prosecution for official misconduct by the defendants, suggested by, e. g. , Note, Nonfeasance: A Threat to the Prosecutors' Discretion, 30 Ind.L.J.
74 (1954), we think the following correctly puts the matter: Nor is there any possibility of private enforcement of criminal laws 49 since Illinois has not provided for such actions by statute.
50 Finally, we need only note the potentially egregious results of denying relief in this case if the allegations are true.
The Constitution prescribes through the Fourteenth Amendment that the states must apply their laws equally.
This view was adopted by the Supreme Court in Yick Wo v. Hopkins , 118 U.S. 356, 373-374 , 6 S.Ct. 1064, 1073 , 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886): Few courts have applied Yick Wo to substantial criminal prosecutions, perhaps because of a failure of proof by various criminal defendants of such invidious discrimination and perhaps from a desire by courts to avoid freeing criminals.
Yet, "when the claim of discriminatory enforcement is raised in an injunction proceeding, it is not as obvious, that recognition of the claim will result in freeing a possible criminal, since an injunction can be limited to enjoin only discriminatory enforcement rather than all enforcement."
Comment, The Right to Nondiscriminatory Enforcement of State Penal Laws, 61 Colum.L.Rev.
1103 , 1109 n. 25 (1961).
We feel that the injunctive remedy proposed by plaintiffs if their case be proved on hearing must be found preferable to a holding that the criminal laws cannot be enforced against blacks who assault whites so long as whites are not being punished for assaults on blacks.
Moreover, considering the lack of alternative remedies, if the federal courts should say to these plaintiffs, after having stripped the Civil Rights Acts of their damage remedy by invoking the concept of judicial immunity, that there is no injunctive relief available, then our system of government of law and not of men will be subject to question.
As Judge Cummings said in Stamler v. Willis , 415 F.2d 1365, 1369-1370 (7th Cir. 1969), "[t]he judiciary has always borne the basic responsibility for protecting individuals against unconstitutional invasions of their rights by all branches of Government."
Our focus has been primarily on the judicial immunity of the judge defendants and the quasi-judicial immunity of the State's attorney defendant.
It obviously follows from what we have said that Shepherd, the investigator, would not be entitled to immunity in any event from injunction and, in all probability, not from a civil rights action for damages.
While the district court spread Berbling's supposed mantle around Shepherd, we note that the investigator from the complaint might seem to border more in the nature of a policeman-detective than one entitled to the protective quasi-judicial immunity from damage actions.
We do not need to decide this issue now as the proof on a trial should establish his status with greater exactitude than we are able to do on the record before us.
Obviously, since this case is before us on a motion to dismiss, it would be improper for us to attempt to spell out in detail any relief the district court might grant if the plaintiffs can prove what they allege.
51 Nevertheless, as this appears to be a case of first impression as to the type of relief approved, we feel obligated to give the district court some guidelines as to what type of remedy might be imposed.
We do not mean to require the district court to sit in constant, day-to-day supervision of either state court judges or the State's attorney.
An initial decree might set out the general tone of rights to be protected and require only periodic reports of various types of aggregate data on actions on bail and sentencing and dispositions of complaints.
Nevertheless, we have complete confidence in the district court's ability to set up further guides as required 52 and if necessary to consider individual decisions.
53 Difficulty of formulating a remedy if a complaint is proved following a trial cannot be grounds for dismissing the complaint ab initio .
We cannot so easily belittle the powers of a court of equity nor the ability of district judges who have grappled with difficult remedies before, e. g. , school desegregation orders, railroad reorganizations.
We also are not unmindful of the possibility of a substantial additional burden being placed on the federal judiciary by our decision.
However, if it can be alleged and proved, and the sweep of our decision is to be no broader, that the state officials consistently, designedly and egregiously have, under color of law, deprived an entire group of citizens of their civil rights, then the additional burden will necessarily have to be assumed.
The civil rights of all persons, too often merely words in a constitutionally inspired century-old statute, deserve no lesser implementation than here accorded them.
Further, in response to the final rhetoric of the dissent, we reemphasize that we have no intent of suggesting that the allegations of the complaint are true.
Certainly we have not intended any intimation that corruption exists on the part of the accused officials.
We have only said that if the allegations are true, and the burden of proving truth is on the plaintiffs, then a federal cause of action has been stated.
For the reasons set out hereinbefore, we reverse and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.
The case shall be reassigned to a different district judge.
Reversed and remanded.
