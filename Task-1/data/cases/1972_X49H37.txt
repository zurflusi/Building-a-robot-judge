 MacKINNON , Circuit Judge: Plaintiff-appellants in this case are a class of persons composed of students at Jefferson Junior High School in the District of Columbia and their parents and guardians.
Defendant-appellees are: (1) The Chairman and Members of the House of Representatives Committee on the District of Columbia 1 ; (2) the Clerk, Staff Director, Counsel and a consultant to the Committee; (3) the Superintendent of Public Documents and the Public Printer, i. e. , the Government Printing Office; (4) the President and Members of the Board of Education of the District of Columbia; (5) the Superintendent of the Public Schools of the District of Columbia; (6) the Principal of Jefferson Junior High School; (7) a teacher at Jefferson Junior High School; (8) a District of Columbia Police Officer acting as an investigator for the Committee; and (9) the United States of America.
Appellants, proceeding in forma pauperis and under fictitious names to preserve their anonymity, commenced this action in the District Court for damages, a declaratory judgment and for an injunction against further publication and distribution of a report of the House of Representatives Committee on the District of Columbia on the District of Columbia School System 2 unless 45 [**284] pages thereof were altered to delete certain names of students.
The pages in question contain copies of: (1) student absentee lists; (2) letters, memoranda, and other papers regarding student disciplinary problems; and (3) student test papers.
3 These documents, which include the true names and addresses of appellants, identify the students in contexts that are, at least partially, derogatory.
Appellants contend, inter alia , that the disclosure, dissemination, and publication of the House Committee Report, so long as it contains the names of said students, violate their constitutional and common law right to privacy, constitute an impermissible bill of attainder, deny them due process of law, violate the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. 1983 (1970), are devoid of any valid legislative purpose, and will cause severe damage to their mental and physical health, their reputations, and appellant-students' future careers.
They also make a contention on appeal which was not raised below, namely, that the House Committee Report was published and distributed in violation of House rules.
The District Court denied appellants' motion for temporary relief and dismissed their complaint.
It found that the House Committee Report had a "legitimate and proper legislative purpose," as demonstrated by the underlying enabling resolution, 4 and it held that it was without jurisdiction to grant the requested injunctive relief by reason of the doctrine of separation of powers.
It further determined that since the acts of the Legislative Branch employees named as defendants were performed by them in the course of their employment, they were absolutely privileged under the doctrine of official immunity.
The District of Columbia defendants were found to be protected by the doctrine that a public officer cannot be liable in money damages, even if he has acted negligently, so long as his act was discretionary.
Finally, the District Court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over any claim against the United States, since appellants had not exhausted their other remedies as required by 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) (1970).
5 This appeal followed.
[**285] Appellants moved this court for summary reversal or an injunction pending appeal.
On January 14, 1971, we issued an injunction to preserve the status quo until responses were filed.
Such order did not enjoin the Members of the House District Committee or the United States, but it did prohibit the other defendant-appellees from any further publication and distribution of the House Committee Report, so long as it contained the names and addresses of pupils and parents.
On March 11, 1971, this court denied appellants' motion for summary reversal, and appellees' motion for summary affirmance, and it modified the injunctive order of January 14, 1971, to permit the publication of names of students absent from school.
It otherwise continued the injunction and ordered the case set for argument on an expedited basis.
The issues have now been briefed and argued, and we hold that the District Court's dismissal was proper.
For the reasons set out below, we have concluded that the District Court was without jurisdiction with respect to the defendant-appellees.
Therefore, we have not found it necessary to consider the merits of the constitutional, statutory, administrative, and common law claims which appellants have asserted.
I Under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress is provided with exclusive legislative authority over the District of Columbia.
6 This pervasive power is accompanied by inherently broad investigatory authority.

The instant case concerns an investigation of the District of Columbia Public School System which was conducted on behalf of the Committee on the District of Columbia of the House of Representatives, by a Special Select Subcommittee of that House District Committee, under the authority of H.R.Res.
76, 91st Congress, 1st Session.
7 The study probed deeply into a great many problems of the District of Columbia School System.
Included were: Administrative Problems, Board of Education of the District of Columbia, Crime in the Schools, D.C. School's Answer to Special Select Subcommittee Questions, Pornography, Revolutionary and other Inflammatory Materials, Damage to Property, Drug Abuse in the Schools, School Budget, Washington Teachers Union, Student Bussing, Student Suspension Policy, Schools without Walls, Open Class Rooms, Open Class Room Concept, Freedom School, Vocational Schools, Student Bill of Rights and Responsibilities and Teacher Comments.
A portion of the study related to absenteeism, student discipline, and educational quality.
On these matters, the 45 pages from 213-258 set forth for Jefferson Junior High School various absence sheets, lists of class cutters and certain reports and information concerning breaches of discipline and suspension problems.
Also included were 19 pages of student test papers for a history examination taken from a fifth grade textbook but given to seventh graders.
The average score was "F" and the report was submitted by the teacher to show the poor reading ability of most of her students.
At the conclusion of the investigation, the House Committee issued a 450-page Report, both for the benefit and use of Congress and for the information of the public.
The material to which appellants object is only a small part of the entire Report.
The Report in its entirety discloses a truly deplorable state of affairs in the public schools of the District of Columbia and obviously one of tremendous congressional concern.
8 Appellants do not challenge the propriety of the investigation or the issuance of the Report generally- i. e. , absent the use of their names--nor could they.
9 They only assert a statutory, common law, and constitutional right to anonymity.
We need not discuss the merits of appellants' innovative claims, [**287] however, since we conclude that all of the defendant-appellees named in the complaint are immune from the suit brought against them. 10 II Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution provides that "for any Speech or Debate in either House, they [Senators and Representatives] shall not be questioned in any other place."
This provision, which was adopted by the Constitutional Convention without debate or opposition, 11 found its roots in the conflict between Parliament and the Crown culminating in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the English Bill of Rights of 1689.
12 In light of this history, [**288] the Supreme Court concluded in United States v. Johnson , 383 U.S. 169, 181 , 86 S.Ct. 749, 755 , 15 L.Ed.2d 681 , (1966), that the purpose of the Speech or Debate Clause was "to prevent intimidation [of legislators] by the executive and accountability before a possibly hostile judiciary."
"In order to enable and encourage a representative of the public to discharge his public trust with firmness and success, it is indispensably necessary, that he should enjoy the fullest liberty of speech, and that he should be protected from the resentment of every one, however powerful, to whom the exercise of that liberty may occasion offense."
13 To accomplish this important objective, the Supreme Court has recognized the necessity for construing the Speech or Debate Clause protection in a broad fashion.

"[I]t would be a 'narrow view' to confine [its] protection .
.
.
to words spoken in debate.
Committee reports , resolutions, and the act of voting are equally covered, as are 'things generally done in a session of the House by one of its members in relation to the business before it.'

14 The Speech or Debate Clause not only provides a defense on the merits, but it generally protects a legislator from the annoyance of having to devote his time and efforts to defending himself in court.

See Dombrowski v. Eastland , 387 U.S. 82, 85 , 87 S.Ct. 1425 , 18 L.Ed.2d 577 (1967).
15 The only question which a [**289] trial court should consider is "whether from the pleadings it appears that the [legislators] were acting in the sphere of legitimate legislative activity."
Tenney v. Brandhove , 341 U.S. 367, 376 , 71 S.Ct. 783, 788 , 95 L.Ed. 1019 (1951).
Since we believe that the activities of the defendant-members of the Committee on the District of Columbia of the House of Representatives "may fairly be deemed within [the Committee's] province," it is clear that the District Court properly dismissed the suit as to them.
Id., at 378 , 71 S.Ct. at 789 .
See United States v. Doe , 455 F.2d 753, 757 (1st Cir. 1972).
As has been noted, appellants concede the authority of the House District Committee to investigate and report to Congress on the District of Columbia Public School System.
They have only questioned the propriety of that small portion of the Committee Report which uses their names in somewhat derogatory contexts.
"That the protection of private rights upon occasion involves an invasion of those rights is in theory a paradox but, in the world as it happens to be, is a realistic problem requiring a practical answer."
Barsky v. United States , supra , 83 U.S.App.D.C.
at 135 , 167 F.2d at 249 .
It is apparent that the House District Committee was faced with a great dilemma.
In its effort to expose the vexing problems which adversely affect the District of Columbia School System, with a view toward the alleviation of such problems to the benefit of all school children, the Committee obviously believed that some disclosure which might possibly injure a few pupils was necessary.
While there may or may not be any substantial public interest in the test papers, discipline memoranda, or absentee lists themselves, the inclusion of such material in the Committee Report clearly increased its credibility.
While some might consider that it was unnecessary to include the names, at a time such as this when "credibility gaps" are frequently mentioned, it was entirely reasonable for the House District Committee to include what it considered to be sufficient factual data to support its findings concerning a controversial and complex area.
Delinquency in the District of Columbia Schools is such a problem and in connection with its investigation of the Student Suspension Policy, which it was investigating, Congress had a right to know the precise details of a few particular disciplinary problems involving the discipline of particular students for particular acts committed in the class rooms of the public schools of the District.
All the details of such circumstances, including the names of the students involved and their acts were relevant and necessary for a full and proper consideration of the matter.
Many of the instances of student delinquency which one hears daily are considered by many to be unbelievable.
Others assert they are untrue.
Under such circumstances the desire of the Committee to present specific evidence to support its findings is understandable.
And the discretion is vested in Congress, not the courts.
We must be careful to remember that under such circumstances, "every reasonable indulgence of legality must be accorded to the actions of [the] coordinate branch of our Government" by the judiciary.
Watkins v. United States , supra , 354 U.S. at 204 , 77 S.Ct. at 1188 .
16 [**290] What is really involved here is Congress functioning as it must with respect to the District of Columbia, as a combination state legislature and education committee that is concerned with a grass roots problem.
As with any local school board problem, this involves individuals, administrators, teachers, employees, parents, students and taxpayers.
The Report recognizes this and to make its study complete and to give it the maximum credibility, the Report throughout, in hundreds of situations in addition to the students involved in disciplinary problems, has named the persons involved.
The Report is replete with names of individuals, groups and organizations, many of which are discussed in connection with highly derogatory conduct.
For instance, in reporting on the narcotics situation, names and incidents are recited of employees who were furnishing narcotics to drivers employed by the schools.
H.R.Rep.
No. 91-1681, 91st Cong., 2d Sess.
109-110 (1970).
Appellants are not singled out.
They are a minor part of the Report.
However, it must be noted that the use of specific names throughout the Report does add considerably to its credibility in an area where reliability is necessary.
"Our function, at this point, is .
.
not to pass judgment upon the general wisdom or efficacy of the activities of this Committee in a vexing and complicated field."
Barenblatt v. United States , supra , 360 U.S. at 125 , 79 S.Ct. at 1092 .
It is merely to determine whether the defendant-legislators were acting within the sphere of their legitimate activity when they collected the information in question and issued the House Committee Report in its present form.
Since it is readily apparent that their actions were within the discretionary area of their constitutional authority, the defendant-Representatives are absolutely protected by the Speech or Debate Clause.
III The legislative immunity provided by the Speech or Debate Clause is not limited to Congressmen, although the doctrine's protection "is less absolute .
.
.
when applied to officers or employees of a legislative body, rather than to legislators themselves."
Dombrowski v. Eastland , supra , 387 U.S. at 85 , 87 S.Ct. at 1427 .
See Tenney v. Brandhove , supra , 341 U.S. at 378 , 71 S.Ct. 783 .
Therefore, when congressional employees or officers are acting pursuant to valid 17 legislative authorization, in furtherance of a proper legislative purpose, they also come within the scope of the Speech or Debate Clause protection.
See United States v. Doe , 455 F.2d 753, 761 (1st Cir. 1972).
There is no contention by appellants that any of the Federal legislative employees named as defendants 18 were acting outside the sphere of their official duties.
They merely performed the incidental functions which were necessary to insure the full accomplishment of the House District Committee's appropriate legislative objective.
In this day of complex public problems, where assignment of authority by legislators to legislative assistants is an absolute necessity if Congress is to be able to perform its [**291] constitutional functions, it would indeed be hollow to afford immunity to the Congressmen, but not to their assistants, for these aides might be hesitant to undertake the full performance of their lawful duties if they had to face the threat of possible lawsuits.
Such an inconsistent result would impossibly hinder congressional activities, and effectively prevent the attainment of the objectives underlying the Speech or Debate Clause.
We therefore must conclude that the suit against the Federal legislative employees 19 was properly dismissed due to their legislative immunity.
Although we could base our decision regarding the Federal legislative employees wholly on the protection afforded them by the Speech or Debate Clause, an additional consideration further demonstrates why the District Court properly refused to enjoin the publication and distribution of the House Committee Report by them.
"If a court could say to the Congress [, and we might add to its authorized agents,] that it could use or could not use information in its possession, the independence of the Legislature would be destroyed and the constitutional separation of the powers of government invaded.
Nothing is better settled than that each of the three great departments of government shall be independent and not subject to be controlled directly or indirectly by either of the others."
Hearst v. Black , 66 App.D.C.
313, 316-317 , 87 F.2d 68, 71-72 (1936).
In Methodist Federation for Social Action v. Eastland , 141 F.Supp.
729 (D.D.C.1956), a decision of a three-judge court, Judge Edgerton speaking for himself and Judge Prettyman said: 141 F.Supp.
at 731-732 .
See Hobson v. Tobriner , 255 F.Supp.
295 (D.D.C.1966).
In light of the assurance provided this court by the Federal appellees that the Chairman and Members of the House District Committee, as presently constituted in the 92d Congress, have no intention of seeking republication or further distribution of the House Committee Report, 20 we believe that the admonition provided by this court in Cole v. McClellan , 142 U.S.App.D.C.
24, 26 , 439 F.2d 534, 536 (1970), is highly relevant: [**292] It is clear that the information in question was provided the legislative investigators by the District of Columbia school officials without objection or protest.
In view of the fact that the Report had already been published and distributed before this action was instituted and that appellants have only asserted vague allegations of anticipated harm at some indefinable future time, we believe that the court below exercised appropriate judicial restraint in dismissing that part of appellants' complaint which sought the enjoining of the publication and dissemination of the House Committee Report.
Any other determination would have caused needless friction between separate and independent departments of the Federal Government.
IV We also decide that all of the District of Columbia defendant-appellees, 21 as well as the Federal legislative employees named in the complaint, 22 are protected from liability 23 in the instant case by the doctrine of official immunity.
Unlike the constitutionally based Speech or Debate Clause protection, the law of privilege as a defense by governmental officials to civil suits has in large part been of judicial making.
Barr v. Matteo , 360 U.S. 564, 569 , 79 S.Ct. 1335 , 3 L.Ed.2d 1434 (1959).
The courts have recognized that "officials of government should be free to exercise their duties unembarrassed by the fear of damage suits in respect of acts done in the course of those duties--suits which would consume time and energies which would otherwise be devoted to governmental service and the threat of which might appreciably inhibit the fearless, vigorous, and effective administration of policies of government."
Id., at 571 , 79 S.Ct. at 1339 .
The basic rationale for this doctrinal approach was excellently expressed by Judge Learned Hand in Gregoire v. Biddle , 177 F.2d 579, 581 (2nd Cir. 1949): [**293] See Barsky v. United States , supra , 83 U.S.App.D.C.
at 136 , 167 F.2d at 250 ; Spalding v. Vilas , 161 U.S. 483, 498-499 , 16 S.Ct. 631 , 40 L.Ed. 780 (1896); David v. Cohen , 132 U.S.App.D.C.
333, 336 , 407 F.2d 1268, 1271 (1969).
Official immunity has not been restricted to those in high government positions.
"The privilege is not a badge or emolument of exalted office, but an expression of a policy designed to aid in the effective functioning of government.
The complexities and magnitude of governmental activity have become so great that there must of necessity be a delegation and redelegation of authority as to many functions, and we cannot say that these functions become less important simply because they are exercised by officers of lower rank in the executive hierarchy."
Barr v. Matteo , supra , 360 U.S. at 572 , 79 S.Ct. at 1340 .
See Cooper v. O'Connor , 66 App.D.C.
100, 107 , 99 F.2d 135, 142 (1938); Farr v. Valentine , 38 App.D.C.
413, 420 (1912).
Therefore, it is clear that this immunity doctrine is applicable with respect to both the District of Columbia and the Federal officials and employees with whom we are herein concerned.
It has been recognized that, to achieve the desired result, official immunity need not be applied to all actions engaged in by any governmental official.
Immunity is only afforded in those instances where the official in question has performed a discretionary 24 --as opposed to a ministerial--act, within the scope of his official duties.
Kendall v. Stokes , 44 U.S. (3 How.) 87, 98 , 11 L.Ed. 506 (1845); Cooper v. O'Connor , supra , 66 App.D.C.
at 103 , 99 F.2d at 138 ; Howard v. Lyons , 360 U.S. 593 , 79 S.Ct. 1331 , 3 L.Ed.2d 164 (1959).
Cf. Wheeldin v. Wheeler , 373 U.S. 647, 651 , 83 S.Ct. 1441 , 10 L.Ed.2d 605 (1963).
Thus a two-part analysis is required: (1) was the individual performing acts within the scope of his official duties, and (2) did the action undertaken require the exercise of discretion.

See Barr v. Matteo , supra , 360 U.S. at 575 , 79 S.Ct. 1335 ; Gregoire v. Biddle , supra , 177 F.2d at 581 .
All of the District of Columbia and Federal officials named as defendants have only engaged in official conduct in furtherance of a duly authorized congressional investigation.
"It is unquestionably the duty of all citizens to cooperate with the Congress in its efforts to obtain the facts needed for intelligent legislative action."
Watkins v. United States , supra , 354 U.S. at 187 , 77 S.Ct. at 1179 .
This obligation is even more compelling where the citizen involved is a governmental official.
Pearson v. Wright , 156 F.Supp.
136, 137 (D.D.C.1957).
See Farr v. Valentine , 38 App.D.C.
413, 419 (1912).
Clearly the failure of an official to cooperate when matters under his control are being examined by a congressional committee would amount to malfeasance in office.
See Cooper v. O'Connor , supra , 66 App.D.C.
at 105 , 99 F.2d at 140 .
We must therefore conclude that all the complained of actions were undertaken by the defendant-officials within the scope of their official authority.
"The test of whether a challenged action is ministerial or non-ministerial is not the office per se or its height, but whether the function itself was of such discretionary nature that the threat of litigation would impede the official to whom it was assigned."
David v. Cohen , supra , 132 U.S.App.D.C.
at 337 , 407 F.2d at 1272 .
All of the pertinent actions undertaken by the officials in question here were non-ministerial.
The District of Columbia school officials were required to exercise judgment in deciding what information they should provide the House District Committee investigators, who in turn, had to exercise clear discretion in determining what data to seek.
25 For these reasons, we are forced to conclude that the District Court properly dismissed the suit against the District of Columbia school officials, 26 as well as against the Federal officials.
27 [**295] For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the District Court must be Affirmed.
