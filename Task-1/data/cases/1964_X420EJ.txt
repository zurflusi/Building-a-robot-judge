 PER CURIAM.
Upon examination and consideration of the record before us, the findings and conclusions of the District Court, the order denying the motion of the defendant that he be permitted to pay "convenient" sums out of future earnings in discharge of his fines, and the order revoking defendant's probation, we find no error.
Affirmed.
