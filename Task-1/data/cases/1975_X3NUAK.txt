 SPRECHER , Circuit Judge.
This appeal involves the sensitive issue of whether the Atomic Energy Commission in approving the site of a commercial nuclear reactor gave due consideration to the population density and use characteristics of the site environs.
I On August 24, 1970, Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) submitted its application for a construction permit and operating license for a 685 megawatt boiling water nuclear power plant to be built on the applicant's Bailly site on the southern shore of Lake Michigan, Westchester Township, Porter County, Indiana.
Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2011-2282 , each application for a commercial license under section 2133 , which must include a Preliminary Safety Analysis Report (PSAR) pursuant to 10 C.F.R. 50.34(a) , is reviewed by the staff of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) through the Division of Reactor Licensing (DRL) pursuant to 10 C.F.R. 1.120 and 2.102(a), and by the 15-member Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2039 and 2232(b).
In this case after the filing of 16 amendments by NIPSCO, ACRS filed its safety report on October 14, 1971, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2232(b) and 10 C.F.R. 2.102(c) and the AEC staff through DRL filed its Safety Evaluation Report (SER) on February 15, 1972.
A general notice of hearing on the application for a construction permit dated December 21, 1971, had been published by AEC on December 29, 1971 in 36 Fed.Reg.
25175 (1971).
An Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) of three members was constituted on January 12, 1972, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2241 and at a prehearing conference held on May 9, 1972, at Valparaiso, Indiana, admitted as Joint Intervenors the following: Porter County Chapter of Izaak Walton League of America, Inc.; Concerned Citizens Against the Bailly Nuclear Site; Businessmen for the Public Interest, Inc.; and James E. Newman, Edward W. Osann, Jr., Mildred Warner and George Hanks.
Bethlehem Steel Corporation was also admitted as a party intervenor.
Because of other commitments, members of the original ASLB were unable to continue to serve and a Notice of Reconstitution of Board was issued on June 20, 1972.
The reestablished ASLB conducted the evidentiary hearing.
In the meantime, NIPSCO had submitted an environmental report on January 7, 1971, which was amended three times.
In July 1972, AEC issued a draft environmental statement and in February 1973, a Final Environmental Statement (FES).
ASLB held evidentiary hearings for 65 days on October 10-13, 1972 at Gary, Indiana, and between April 30 and November 14, 1973, at Valparaiso, Indiana.
Oral arguments on proposed findings were held on February 19, 1974.
1 The Initial Decision of ASLB authorizing the issuance of a construction permit was entered on April 5, 1974, and reported in Regulatory Adjudication Issuances of AEC.
NIPSCO, LBP-74-19, RAI-74-4, 557 (April 5, 1974).
The Joint Intervenors appealed the Initial Decision, which was affirmed by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Board consisting of three members (ASLAB), pursuant to 10 C.F.R. 2.785(a) , on August 29, 1974.
NIPSCO, ALAB-224, RAI-74-8, 244 (Aug. 29, 1974).
Unless the AEC undertakes sua sponte a review of an ASLAB decision pursuant to 10 C.F.R. 2.786 , that decision becomes the final decision of the AEC, 10 C.F.R. 2.770 and 2.785(a).
2 Thereafter any final decision is subject to judicial review in the court of appeals, 42 U.S.C. 2239(b) and 28 U.S.C. 2342(4) , where the petitioner resides or has its principal office or in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 28 U.S.C. 2343 .
On September 13, 1974, the Joint Intervenors petitioned this court to review the August 29, 1974 order of ASLAB authorizing the issuance to NIPSCO of the construction permit and the September 5, 1974 order of ASLAB denying Joint Intervenors' motion for remand for further proceedings to consider NIPSCO's alleged participation in the proposed building of another nuclear plant in the early 1980's near Madison, Indiana.
NIPSCO, ALAB-227, RAI-74-9, 416 (Sept. 5, 1974).
By orders of this court of September 20, October 3, and November 8, 1974, NIPSCO, the State of Illinois and the City of Gary, Indiana, were admitted as intervenors.
On September 18, Joint Intervenors 3 moved in this court for a stay pending appeal and on October 4, the government moved for leave to reopen the administrative proceedings for further hearing on NIPSCO's proposal to construct a slurry wall at the site.
On October 16, 1974, we ordered (1) that the AEC order of August 29 be stayed pending review of that decision; (2) that AEC be permitted to reopen its administrative proceedings for further hearings upon the environmental impact of the building of a slurry wall; (3) that any action by AEC permitting the construction of a slurry wall be stayed pending further order of this court after AEC has rendered a final decision concerning the slurry wall; and (4) that an expedited briefing schedule be followed.
On November 15, 1974, the Joint Intervenors moved this court for clarification of the October 16 order to determine whether that order required NIPSCO to fill in the existing excavation on the site as well as to cease any further site dewatering.
On November 18, that motion was ordered taken with the case at the time of oral argument on December 11, 1974.
The arguments on appeal made by Joint Intervenors, Illinois and Gary are multi-faceted but all revolve ultimately upon whether AEC gave due consideration to the population density and use characteristics of the site environs.
II The proposed site for locating this commercial nuclear reactor is unique in many respects.
The site is a reverse L-shaped 350-acre tract of land in Porter County, Indiana, on the south shore of Lake Michigan.
The shorter base of the L runs from Lake Michigan to the south and constitutes the 107-acre tract on which the nuclear plant is sought to be located.
The longer leg of the reverse L runs at a right angle from the southern end of the base from west to east and contains the remaining approximately 250 acres.
The reverse L-shaped nuclear site abuts the western boundary and the southern boundary of the western portion of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, an irregularly shaped area that stretches some eleven miles along the south shore of Lake Michigan directly east of the 107-acre portion of the reactor site.
In 1966 Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to establish the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore "[i]n order to preserve for the educational, inspirational, and recreational use of the public certain portions of the Indiana Dunes and other areas of scenic, scientific, and historic interest and recreational value.
.
.
."
16 U.S.C. 460u .
On September 20, 1972, the National Park Service published a notice stating that "there has been acquired within the boundaries of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore an acreage which is efficiently administrable for the purposes of said Act and, therefore the Lake Shore is hereby established."
37 Fed.Reg.
19389 (1972).
The National Lakeshore has thus far acquired 8300 acres or 85 percent of the land authorized by Congress to be acquired.
Interspread within but not a part of the National Lakeshore acreage are the towns of Dune Acres and Beverly Shores and the Indiana Dunes State Park, which consists of an additional 2,200 acres and occupies approximately three of the eleven miles of beach shore.
Most of the 8300 acres is open dune and wetland.
The ASLB found and concluded: NIPSCO, LBP-74-19, supra at 586-87 (Finding 103).
4 On the 107-acre site where the plant is sought to be located, NIPSCO operates two coal-fired electrical generating stations and a gas turbine peaking plant.
The proposed nuclear facility would be built west of the three existing plants.
On the west and south sides of the proposed site, Bethlehem Steel Corporation operates a steel plant employing some 7,500 employees.
To the west of the Bethlehem plant is the proposed Port of Indiana.
In fact the area south and west of the site is a "vast industrial and urban complex [within which] are five major cities--Gary, Hammond, East Chicago, Whiting [all in Indiana] and Chicago, [Illinois] and numerous municipalities intermeshed .
.
.
[within which] almost 7 million people live."
(Joint Intervenors' Ex. 23).
The downtown Chicago loop area is about 30 miles from the site.
Downtown Gary is about 12 miles and the eastern boundary of Gary is 5.25 miles from the proposed reactor building.
The cumulative population density data in the record shows actual and projected population at various distances from the Bailly site (October 1973 Stipulation; Staff Ex. 12) as follows: Distance from Population Bailly 1970 1985 0-5 miles 20,432 29,793 0-20 miles 600,000 700,000 0-30 miles 2,276,579 2,502,531 0-40 miles 5,000,000 6,000,000 III In enacting the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, Congress found that the regulation of the facilities used in connection with the production and utilization of atomic energy was necessary, among other purposes, "to protect the health and safety of the public."
42 U.S.C. 2012(e) .
Another purpose was to provide "a program to encourage widespread participation in the development and utilization of atomic energy for peaceful purposes to the maximum extent consistent with the common defense and security and with the health and safety of the public."
42 U.S.C. 2013(d) .
"[N]o license [for a utilization or production facility] may be issued to any person within the United States if, in the opinion of the Commission, the issuance of a license to such person would be inimical to the common defense and security or to the health and safety of the public."
42 U.S.C. 2133(d) .
Finally, in connection with the applications for licenses to operate facilities, the applicant shall furnish such information "as the Commission may, by rule or regulation, deem necessary in order to enable it to find that the utilization or production of special nuclear material will be in accord with the common defense and security and will provide adequate protection to the health and safety of the public."
42 U.S.C. 2232(a) .
In evaluating the proposed site for a nuclear reactor the AEC has promulgated regulations which provide that it "will take .
.
.
into consideration" three factors: 10 C.F.R. 100.10 .
Population density and use characteristics are further defined in 10 C.F.R. 100.11 .
A license applicant is directed to assume (a) a fission product release from the core, (b) the expected demonstrable leak rate from the containment and (c) the meteorological conditions pertinent to his site, in order to derive the three area or population buffer zones of (1) exclusion area, (2) low population zone and (3) population center distance.
The size or area of the first two buffer zones is determined by calculating that certain maximum radiation dosages, for stated periods after an accident, to an individual located on the outer boundaries of each zone not be exceeded.
The third zone is one and one-third times the distance from the reactor to the outer boundary of the second zone.
5 NIPSCO in its brief before us has emphasized the complexity of determining the first two buffer zones "because each of the principal elements .
.
.
(fission product release, containment leak rate, meteorological conditions) depends upon the applicant's proposed reactor plant design and site," making "no single formula" possible.
(Br. at 10-11).
The regulations, and the record herein insofar as it pertains to NIPSCO's attempt to comply with them, confirm the complex nature of determining the critical factor of "population density and use characteristics of the site environs" in regard at least to the first two buffer zones.
Because of the complexity of that determination, which necessarily subsumes the expertise of the AEC in reaching definitive conclusions, we turn first to the problem of determining the third buffer zone, the solution of which is relatively simple and merely involves a mathematical computation and the interpretation of non-technical language, an area where no expertise beyond normal adjudication is required.
See 4 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise 30.09 (1958 ed. and 1970 Supp.).
10 C.F.R. 100.11(a)(3) describes the third buffer zone as: 10 C.F.R. 100.3(c) adds: The ASLB approved NIPSCO's and the AEC Regulatory Staff's calculations of the radii of the three population buffer zones as follows: (1) Exclusion Area: 188 meters or .1168 mile.
NIPSCO, LBP-74-19, supra at 561 , 563 (Findings 14, 19); (2) Low Population Zone: 2413 meters or 1.5 miles.
Id. at 561 , 563, 565 (Findings 14, 19, 24); (3) Population Center Distance: 3219 meters or 2 miles.
Id. at 565 (Finding 24).
As stated earlier, Findings (1) and (2) are based on radiation dosage calculations but (3) is simply 1 ⅓ times (2).
In accordance with these findings, the application of the 10 C.F.R. 100 regulations would require that no "densely populated center containing more than about 25,000 residents" be located at or nearer than two miles from the reactor.
The City of Portage, Indiana, had a population of 19,127 in 1970 but the ASLB found that "[u]pon questioning concerning the City of Portage, the Staff acknowledged the expected population of Portage by 1980 would exceed 25,000."
NIPSCO, LBP-74-19, supra at 565 (Finding 24).
Without so finding, ASLB referred to evidence that "the nearest boundary [of Portage] was 1.1 miles from the reactor site."
Id .
The briefs of both the government and NIPSCO accept the fact that the political or municipal or corporate boundary of Portage is approximately one mile from the reactor.
6 Inasmuch as the site evaluation factors are promulgated to insure the safety of the adjoining population, 7 "[a]t the very least, consideration should .
.
.
be given to the best available estimates as to what will be the population in the general vicinity of the reactor during the early years of actual operation."
8 The evidence here is uncontroverted that the population of Portage will grow to 25,000 between 1976 and 1977 and to about 29,000 in 1980, the early years of expected operation of this reactor.
The ASLB and eventually the ASLAB accepted the Regulatory Staff's argument that the political boundary of Portage was to be ignored and instead some amorphous, flexible and movable center or centroid of population was to be considered.
The fatal error in this alleged logic is that AEC itself has defined "population center distance" as the distance from the reactor "to the nearest boundary of a densely populated center containing more than about 25,000 residents."
10 C.F.R. 100.3(c) (emphasis added).
NIPSCO's own witness conceded that "the centroid itself doesn't have a boundary; it is a point."
Section 100.11(a) (3) also adds: But giving such due consideration to population distribution does not eliminate the need to establish a boundary.
Recently the ASLAB in another case found that the city limits of San Clemente, with an estimated future population likely to exceed 25,000, was within the population center distance and required a recalculation of radiation dosage distances.
9 We agree with AEC's ASLAB in that case, that a densely populated center may extend beyond the political or corporate limits of the 25,000 population unit, but there is neither reason nor sound safety policy to cut down the boundaries of that unit and make some hopeless attempt to construct imaginary boundaries.
The ASLB in this case recognized the fallacy of substituting centroids for boundaries 10 and found as follows: NIPSCO, LBP-74-19, supra at 565 (Finding 25).
The map relied upon for the "pink" sections (thus having boundaries) is the United States Department of the Interior geological survey of the Portage quadrangle.
The map is "revised from aerial photographs taken 1967" and "field checked 1968."
It must be kept in mind that the principal portion of the hearings in this case took place in 1973, at least five years later.
The map purports to show individual dwellings as dots but the "pink," or what the map refers to as "red tint," simply indicates areas where individual dwellings are not shown.
The map itself makes no representations or even references to population.
The map clearly indicates the "corporate boundary of Portage" as being about one mile from the reactor.
In the critical determination of the "Population Center Distance," it would be ludicrous to attempt to reduce the political boundaries of the population center by such vague and indefinite references.
Presumably, the cartographers could have tinted any part of the Portage quadrangle pink inasmuch as they indicated no guidelines which they used in selecting the areas so tinted.
Here the corporate boundary of Portage was about one mile from the reactor and the evidence showed that the boundary of census enumeration district 719 of Portage as well as the boundary of the enumeration district representing the entire City of Portage were both less than a mile from the reactor.
Since both the ASLB and ASLAB found that the boundary of a densely populated center containing more than about 25,000 residents must be at least two miles away from the reactor, their conclusion that a construction permit be granted cannot stand.
This conclusion does not take into consideration the additional fact that the boundaries of each of the communities of Dune Acres, Porter and Burns Harbor are also less than two miles from the reactor and that their total population, when included with that of Portage and unincorporated county areas within two miles, of course, exceeds 25,000.
Nor does this conclusion take into consideration the fact, discussed in greater detail later, that the master plan for the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore contemplates that "[a]ctive use of all of the facilities provided for in this plan, both in the State Park and in the Lakeshore, will permit a maximum visitation of about 87,000 persons a day."
(Joint Intervenors' Ex. 23).
Presumably, a large portion of such visitors would or could come within the two-mile limit of the third buffer zone, but such a conclusion is not necessary because the AEC siting regulations have been violated in this case on the basis of Portage alone.
It is also important to consider that Bethlehem Steel Corporation's 7,500 employees are located at about one mile from the Bailly site.
IV In view of the vast consequences of shutting off or delaying a potential source of considerable energy in these times of energy crisis, together with the effect of such an occurrence upon the economic, financial and industrial well-being and development of northern Indiana, obviously we cannot finally act without giving very serious consideration to every possible factor which may conceivably bear upon the problem.
The factors in favor of granting the permit are so pervasive and weighty that they are impossible to ignore.
Northern Indiana, as the entire country, has a need for additional generating power, employment and economic assistance.
Witness after witness made so-called "limited appearance statements," appearing on their own behalf or on behalf of a group or organization or utility or union, requesting that a construction permit be issued in order to provide additional energy, jobs or stimuli to the economy.
It is pertinent to note, however, that almost every witness in one fashion or another conditioned his request upon either his hope or confidence that AEC would adequately protect the public safety and, in some cases, also protect the environment.
In fact these circumstances militating in favor of the permit are so overwhelming that perhaps the AEC in a completely well-intentioned and good faith effort to accomplish ends which everyone seeks to accomplish has tended to become somewhat lax in assuring that the means employed thereby function in as safe a manner as possible so that one day we do not come to regret the proliferation of nuclear power.
Judge Oakes of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals recently noted in a dissent his concern "that the AEC is charged with the dual duty of passing on licenses on the one hand but promoting the use of atomic power on the other."
Morningside Renewal Council, Inc. v. AEC , 482 F.2d 234, 240-41 (2d Cir. 1973), cert. denied , 417 U.S. 951 , 94 S.Ct. 3080 , 41 L.Ed.2d 672 (1974).
11 Presumably, this observation has been largely invalidated by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 which purports to divide the promotional and research aspects of atomic energy, to be administered by the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA), from the licensing and regulatory functions, to be administered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).
Nevertheless, the orders which we are presently reviewing occurred under the old AEC procedure and the merging of the diverse functions thereunder may explain to a certain extent some of the factors which we next consider.
A AEC appears to have given no direct consideration to the clustering of nuclear power plants around the southern end of Lake Michigan within relatively short distances from the density of population of metropolitan Chicago.
Although there appears to be no likelihood of a chain-reaction effect which would lead an accident from one plant to another, recent developments indicate that plants built within a contemporary time period tend to develop structural deficiencies at or about the same time.
12 There are presently eight nuclear power plants within about 75 miles of downtown Chicago 13 and six more are in the planning stage.
14 The Bailly Generating Station, Nuclear-1, as this plant has been designated, would be the fifteenth plant clustered around metropolitan Chicago.
The AEC siting regulations as they pertain to the population center distance, discussed supra in Part III, provide in part: 10 C.F.R. 100.11(a)(3) .
This distance referred to, in the circumstances of the present case, is, of course, two miles, but the regulations indicate AEC's awareness that consideration must be given to "very large cities" such as Chicago.
In what the ASLAB called "the draft of an internal staff working paper pertaining to allowable levels of population density around nuclear plant sites" (NIPSCO, ALAB-224, supra at 252 ), AEC's staff noted as of April 17, 1973: 15 16 When the AEC made the staff working paper public on April 9, 1974, the AEC press release accompanying the paper virtually repeated one year later that: AEC Press Release, T-160 at 2 (April 9, 1974).
In Power Reactor Development Co. v. International Union of Electrical Workers , 367 U.S. 396 , 81 S.Ct. 1529 , 6 L.Ed.2d 924 (1961), the Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals which had set aside an AEC order issuing a construction permit, saying: 108 U.S.App.D.C.
97 280 F.2d 645, at 651-652 Id. at 414 , 81 S.Ct. at 1538 .
17 In the Power Reactor case, the majority had disposed of "the fears of nuclear disaster" by pointing out that the issuance of the construction permit was only the first step, and that the applicant would be required to satisfy safety-of-operations requirements prior to obtaining an operating permit.
In 1962, however, Congress amended the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to eliminate the two-hearing requirement in effect at the time of the decision of Power Reactor .
The mandatory hearing is now required only prior to the issuance of the construction permit.
Union of Concerned Scientists v. AEC , 499 F.2d 1069, 1074-80 (D.C.Cir.
1974).
It is now unquestionably true as Mr. Justice Douglas said in his dissent in Power Reactor that "the time when the issue of 'safety' must be resolved is before the Commission issues a construction permit."
367 U.S. at 419 , 81 S.Ct. at 1540 .
The Senate Report accompanying the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, included the following observations: 18 19 Despite these factors, the AEC gave no direct consideration to the effect of the existence of from eight to fifteen nuclear plants clustered around the Chicago metropolitan population.
B Not only did the AEC disregard what at least some of its expert staff deemed important population considerations, but it also disregarded its own past course of conduct in approving nuclear power sites.
The 1973 Working Paper prepared by the AEC Regulatory Staff ( supra , note 16) analyzed all sites which up to that time (April 1973) had been given consideration for licensing, and listed each one together with both its maximum Site Population Factor (SPF) 20 and the SPF at 50 miles.
Sixty-eight proposed and actual sites are listed and Bailly, which is 30 miles from downtown Chicago, has the sixth highest SPF at 50 miles.
The five sites with a higher SPF at that distance according to rank were: (1) Ravenswood, (2) Indian Point, (3) Newbold Island, (4) Limerick and (5) Zion.
Ravenswood was withdrawn as a proposed site because of population considerations.
21 In October 1973, the AEC informed the applicant utility that Newbold Island was not suitable because of population density.
Because of the high population density at Limerick, the AEC staff issued special safety evaluations.
With regard to high population density sites the staff stated: Staff Working Paper, supra note 16 at B-5.
Id. at 1 .
The Bailly site is closer to downtown Chicago than the Zion site.
Furthermore, if the granting of a construction permit to Bailly was allowed to stand, Bailly would achieve the dubious distinction of being nestled within one of the top few most dense population areas of all 68 sites proposed thus far in the United States for siting nuclear power plants.
22 C In September 1974, the AEC issued its Draft Regulatory Guide 4.7, General Site Suitability Criteria for Nuclear Power Stations (Sept. 1974), 23 which included the following: 24 Id. at 14 .
The agency which the AEC specifically indicates "should be consulted" in regard to a National Lakeshore is the National Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior.
Congress has delegated its authority over the public lands of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore to the Secretary of the Interior.
16 U.S.C. 460u-460u-9 .
In response to the draft environmental statement, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Interior wrote on October 19, 1972: Nathaniel Reed, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior testified before the ASLB and after establishing a host of impacts which the adjoining Bailly plant would have on the National Lakeshore, the following occurred: Draft Regulatory Guide 4.7 continues: Draft Regulatory Guide, supra at 14 .
The ASLAB in this case found: NIPSCO, ALAB-224, supra , at 262.
To summarize, dunes and wetlands are prime candidates for future designation as public recreational sites, and if adjacent, or near to a proposed nuclear site it is rendered unsuitable.
Yet long-recognized valuable natural areas which have already been designated as recreational sites and which abut hard against a proposed nuclear site are deemed suitable.
And although consultation with cognizant government agencies is intended to determine the acceptability of such sites, when the Department of the Interior upon consultation is "completely against the site irrevocably," that site is accepted.
The ASLAB summarized the Interior Department's and other witnesses' testimony and evidence of the chief factors of direct harm to the Lakeshore environment: (1) lowering the ground water table during construction would concomitantly lower the water level of bogs and ponds in the National Lakeshore, permanently damaging the delicate ecological systems in those unique wetlands; (2) operation of the facility's cooling tower will emit a water vapor plume that would (a) merge with chemical emissions from nearby industrial smokestacks to form an "acid mist" deleterious to Lakeshore biota, (b) deposit salt residues that will further injure the Lakeshore biota as well as pollute Lake Michigan and (c) worsen weather conditions in the area; (3) operations of the nuclear facility would pollute Lake Michigan with undesirable (including radioactive) waste materials; (4) use of ash ponds now on the Bailly property in conjunction with the new facility would pollute the National Lakeshore into which they assertedly drain; (5) intake of additional cooling water for the nuclear facility would destroy substantial quantities of fish in the Lake; and (6) the cooling tower would constitute a "visual intrusion" looming unattractively over the natural horizons of the Lakeshore.
NIPSCO, ALAB-224, supra at 259 .
In regard to the massive visual intrusion of the cooling tower 400-450 feet tall and 440 feet in diameter at its base, from the top of which "[d]uring operation, there will always be a visible plume .
.
.
ranging in length from a few tower heights to several miles," (NIPSCO, LBP-74-4, supra , at 599 (Finding 131)), ASLB found: Id. at 600 (Finding 133).
This finding although "factored into" the total consideration was ignored.
D We have considered the population density and environs factors within the 30-75 mile zone around Bailly (IV A and B, supra ) and within the two-mile (third buffer) zone around Bailly (III, supra ) as well as the abutting environment (IV C, supra ).
Next we consider the two closest population zones (the first and second buffer zones).
The first zone or "exclusion area" is the place where the reactor is situated and a relatively small area immediately surrounding the physical plant.
25 In this case the ASLB and ASLAB approved an exclusion area of 188 meters or .1168 mile or approximately 1/10th of a mile.
Before examining in detail two AEC documents which we have briefly referred to earlier, the 1973 Working Paper on population distribution and Draft Regulatory Guide 4.7 on general site suitability criteria, it is necessary to make a few observations.
The AEC had been striving, prior to its recent demise in favor of NRC, to standardize its approach to the licensing of nuclear power plants.
26 One of the more important benefits of increased standardization anticipated by AEC was the enhancement of reactor safety. 27 Draft Regulatory Guide 4.7 is part of the standardization process, 28 and the 1973 Working Paper, 29 which the ASLAB dismissed as "simply a tentative position proposed by some members of the regulatory staff" (NIPSCO, ALAB-224, supra at 254 ), was accompanied by the AEC's own press release which stated: AEC Press Release, T-160 at 1 (April 9, 1974).
We use both the guide and the working paper, not as superseding the Commission's regulations, but merely as an expression of at least some AEC expertise to be examined in areas where the regulations are not clear or specific.
We assume that if they offered no guidance, the AEC would not have issued and released them.
In Part III supra , we found that the Commission had violated its own regulations.
In Part IV, we are examining other aspects of the AEC's action in granting the Bailly permit to determine whether, on balance, the extraordinary result of halting or delaying the development of needed energy is warranted by the Commission's violation of its regulations.
In this latter inquiry we seek, not eschew, whatever expertise the AEC has to offer, including the guide and the working paper.
The working paper proposes the following regulatory position: 10 CFR Part 100 Staff Working Paper, supra note 16 at A-4.
It was stipulated that the projected population at Bailly in 1985 would be as follows: 0-5 miles 29,793 0-20 miles 700,000 0-40 miles 6,000,000 In addition to consideration of alternate sites and added safety features, such a site calls for "a minimum exclusion distance of at least 0.4 mile" or 4/10th of a mile or four times greater than that proposed for Bailly.
Draft Regulatory Guide 4.7 provides that "[b]ased on past experience, the Regulatory staff has found that a minimum exclusion distance of 0.4 mile .
.
.
usually provides assurance that engineered safety features can be designed to bring the calculated dose from a postulated accident within the guidelines of 10 CFR Part 100 ."

If the exclusion area or first buffer zone in the present case were to be increased fourfold, it would extend beyond the NIPSCO-owned property into areas where NIPSCO could not "determine all activities" 30 and would raise serious questions of interference with the authority of the Secretary of the Interior over the National Lakeshore.
31 A similar problem exists in connection with the second buffer area--the low population zone.
32 The low population zone here was established by the ASLB and ASLAB at 1.5 miles.
The working paper establishes "a low population zone of at least 2 miles" (Staff Working Paper, supra note 16 at A-4) and the guide states that "the Regulatory staff has found that a distance of 3 miles to the outer boundary of the LPZ is usually adequate."
Draft Regulatory Guide, supra at 18 .
Even at 1.5 miles, the LPZ extends over about 640 acres of Class IV land, namely "an outstanding natural area of special significance for public edification."
NIPSCO, LBP-74-19, supra at 586 .
But more significantly, it is anticipated that as many as 87,000 persons a day will visit the Dunes National Lakeshore and State Park (Joint Intervenors' Ex. 23).
It must be presumed that a large number of people will be on the affected 640 acres at any particular time.
Although 10 C.F.R. 100.3(b) speaks of the protection of residents, the need to protect visitors or transients regularly present is equally as great.
33 The ASLAB acknowledged that "[t]o be sure, were there any accident at Bailly, it might be necessary to evacuate visitors from the National Lakeshore as from other surrounding areas," (NIPSCO, ALAB-224, supra at 261 n.34), but dismissed this "remote contingency" by saying that the National Lakeshore superintendent could "work it out."

It appears to us that this problem should be worked out in advance by AEC and the utility seeking a license, rather than by what it is anticipated a third party may do.
Furthermore, the third party, in this case the Department of Interior, has not reacted in a very reassuring manner in regard to this problem.
The Master Plan for the Dunes National Lakeshore (Joint Intervenors' Ex. 23) says: And this is in reference to a quiet Sunday afternoon.
What would occur if a large but unknown number of campers and visitors, unfamiliar with the area and with no nearby homes in which to take shelter, heard a public address announcement to evacuate the area due to a nuclear accident?
Their path would be blocked on the north by Lake Michigan and on the west and south by NIPSCO's and Bethlehem Steel Corporation's plants and industrial complex.
It strains credulity to expect that this problem will work itself out and it is ridiculous to in effect say that it should be left to fortune.
What we have considered in sections A through D above is concerned with "population density and use characteristics of the site environs."
10 C.F.R. 100.10(b) .
V We are compelled to conclude that since the AEC did not comply with its own applicable regulations (Part III, supra ), which are binding on it, 34 and since there are so many persuasive reasons for requiring it to comply with those regulations in this case (Part IV, supra ), the AEC's decision of August 29, 1974 is unlawful and is hereby set aside.
35 In view of this result and in response to Joint Intervenors' motion for clarification of our October 16 stay order, which now becomes permanent, we hold that NIPSCO is required to fill in the existing excavation on the site as well as to cease any further site dewatering.
