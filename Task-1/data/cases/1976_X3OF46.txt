 LAY , Circuit Judge.
This interlocutory appeal is brought under 28 U.S.C. 1292(b) by six major pharmaceutical firms, defendants in the district court in antitrust treble damage suits brought by the governments of several foreign countries. 1 The sole question certified for appeal is whether the district court was correct in holding that foreign governments are "persons" entitled to sue for treble damages under 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15 .
We affirm the judgment of the district court.
All parties agree this is a case of first impression.
2 Civil suits by foreign sovereigns have long been recognized in federal courts.
See The Sapphire , 78 U.S. 164 , 11 Wall. 164 , 20 L.Ed. 127 (1870).

It is agreed, however, that whether a foreign government may sue under the Clayton Act turns on the interpretation of the statute and nothing more.
Our task is to determine the intent of Congress in passing the Act.
4 Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides: 15 U.S.C. 15 .
Section 1 of the Act provides the following definition: 15 U.S.C. 12 .
The Supreme Court has stated, with reference to the antitrust laws, Cooper there is no hard and fast rule of exclusion 312 U.S. at 604-05 61 S.Ct. at page 743 85 L.Ed. at 1071 Georgia v. Evans , 316 U.S. 159, 161 , 62 S.Ct. 972, 974 , 86 L.Ed. 1346, 1350 (1942) (emphasis added).
Two decisions of the United States Supreme Court offer guidance, but beyond these we find little relevant help in construing the statute.
In United States v. Cooper Corp. , 312 U.S. 600 , 61 S.Ct. 742 , 85 L.Ed. 1071 (1941), the Court decided that the United States government was not within the definition of "person" under the antitrust laws.
One year later, however, in Georgia v. Evans , 316 U.S. 159 , 62 S.Ct. 972 , 86 L.Ed. 1346 (1942), the Court held that Congress intended a state of the United States to be a "person" entitled to sue for treble damages.
5 The appellant pharmaceutical firms rely on Cooper in urging that foreign governments are not entitled to sue.
In Cooper , the Supreme Court found that Congress' provision of certain antitrust sanctions and remedies available only to the United States indicated an intent to exclude the United States government from the class of persons entitled to sue for treble damages.
The Court pointed out in Cooper that only the United States could institute criminal prosecutions, request injunctions to restrain violations, and seize goods owned under contracts which violated the antitrust laws.
6 Cooper does contain passages which on the surface lend support to appellants' argument.
The Court observed: 312 U.S. at 604 , 61 S.Ct. at 743 , 85 L.Ed. at 1074 .
The Court further stated: Id. at 606 , 61 S.Ct. at 744 , 85 L.Ed. at 1075 .
Finally, the Court concluded: Id. at 607 , 61 S.Ct. at 745 , 85 L.Ed. at 1076 .
However, these observations must be read in light of the subsequent decision of Georgia v. Evans , supra , which recognized that the word "person", as used in the antitrust laws, did include the governments of domestic states.
In Evans , Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out that Cooper held only that, due to the alternative antitrust weapons granted to the United States government, that government was not entitled to sue for treble damages as well.
However, he emphasized that Cooper did not hold "that the word 'person', abstractly considered, could not include a governmental body."
316 U.S. at 161 , 62 S.Ct. at 973 , 86 L.Ed. at 1350 .
Thus, in Evans , the Court distinguished Cooper by focusing on the distinctions between the array of remedies and sanctions given to the United States government and the single remedy of a treble damage suit provided to others who might be injured due to antitrust violations.
In Evans the Court said: Cooper 8 7 316 U.S. at 162-63 , 62 S.Ct. at 974 , 86 L.Ed. at 1350 .
We find the same reasoning applicable to a foreign sovereign who claims injury due to antitrust violations and seeks to recover treble damages under the Clayton Act.
When Congress enacted the antitrust laws, it expressly recognized that illegal contracts, conspiracies and monopolies by domestic firms may affect commerce with other nations. 7 In view of the holding in Evans that Congress intended domestic state governments to have standing to sue for treble damages under the antitrust laws, we conclude that Congress intended other bodies politic, such as a foreign government, to enjoy the same right.
8 There is certainly no indication of a contrary intent in the legislative history.
In contrast to Cooper , no other provisions of the Act support the contention that Congress intended to exclude foreign nations.
We find that the district court correctly held that foreign nations are "persons" under 4 of the Act entitled to sue for treble damages.
The judgment is affirmed.
