 ERVIN , Circuit Judge: Gladys Pulliam, Magistrate for Culpeper County, Virginia, appeals from an order of the district court awarding $7,308.00 in attorney fees against her pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. 1988 .
Pulliam contends that, as a judicial officer, she is absolutely immune from an award of attorney fees.
In the alternative, she contends that the district court abused its discretion by awarding excessive attorney fees.
We hold that judicial officers are not immune from an award of attorney fees in an action in which prospective relief is properly awarded against a judicial officer.
We also hold that the attorney fees awarded by the district court were reasonable in this case. The order of the district court, therefore, is affirmed.
I. On January 10, 1980, Richmond R. Allen was arrested in Culpeper County, Virginia, on a charge for which incarceration is not authorized under Virginia law. 1 Magistrate Pulliam incarcerated Allen until his trial fourteen days later, however, solely because he was not able to meet $250.00 bail.
2 He was not advised of his right to appointed counsel or taken before a judge 3 until his trial before the Honorable Basil C. Burke, Jr.
in the General District Court of Culpeper County.
Allen subsequently brought a 42 U.S.C. 1983 action against Magistrate Pulliam and Judge Burke in which he sought declaratory and injunctive relief.
He alleged that he had been incarcerated for a non-incarcerable offense and denied his right to counsel in violation of his rights under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.
4 The district court declared unconstitutional the practice of incarcerating persons for non-incarcerable offenses solely for failure to meet bail and granted injunctive relief against Magistrate Pulliam, in her official capacity.
5 Because the court found that incarceration was unconstitutional in the first instance, it did not reach the issues concerning Allen's rights following incarceration.
Allen subsequently filed a request for $7,308.00 in attorney fees and costs pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. 1988 .
The request was based on the actual hours spent on the case calculated at an hourly rate of $60.00.
Magistrate Pulliam filed an objection to the request on the ground that it was excessive.
She argued that (1) the fees requested should have been based only on the work performed on the issues decided in Allen's favor and not for work on the issues never reached by the court; (2) an hourly rate of $60.00 was excessive; and (3) the request included an unnecessary six-hour trip to Alexandria, Virginia, to file a complaint.
The district court awarded the requested fees, finding that (1) although the first appearance and right to counsel issues were not central to the case, they could have been important had Allen lost on the first issue; (2) an hourly rate of $60.00 was reasonable because there were serious constitutional issues involved, the claim was novel, and the case was handled skillfully by Allen's counsel; (3) none of the time spent appeared to be wasteful; and (4) the time allotted for filing the complaint and acquiring permission to proceed in forma pauperis was not unreasonable.
The court further noted that the case was a contingency case, which weighed against any decrease in what the court described as the "modest" amount requested.
II.
Although judges and prosecutors are absolutely immune from liability for money damages, Stump v. Sparkman , 435 U.S. 349 , 98 S.Ct. 1099 , 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978); Imbler v. Pachtman , 424 U.S. 409 , 96 S.Ct. 984 , 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976); Pierson v. Ray , 386 U.S. 547 , 87 S.Ct. 1213 , 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967), this court has held, in Timmerman v. Brown , 528 F.2d 811, 814 (4th Cir. 1975), rev'd on other grounds sub nom.
Leeke v. Timmerman , 454 U.S. 83 , 102 S.Ct. 69 , 70 L.Ed.2d 65 (1981), 6 that judicial immunity does not extend to injunctive and declaratory relief under 42 U.S.C. 1983 .
Accord , Heimbach v. Village of Lyons , 597 F.2d 344, 347 (2d Cir. 1979); Harris v. Harvey , 605 F.2d 330, 335 n.7 (7th Cir. 1979), cert. denied , 445 U.S. 938 , 100 S.Ct. 1331 , 63 L.Ed.2d 772 (1980); Kelsey v. Fitzgerald , 574 F.2d 443, 444 (8th Cir. 1978); Shipp v. Todd , 568 F.2d 133, 134 (9th Cir. 1978).
The question presently before us is whether a judicial official is liable for attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. 1988 when judicial immunity is not a bar to prospective relief.
The Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. 1988 , provides that in any action under 42 U.S.C. 1983 , the district court, "in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs."
See Hutto v. Finney , 437 U.S. 678, 694 , 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2575 , 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978).
In Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union , 446 U.S. 719, 738-39 , 100 S.Ct. 1967, 1978 , 64 L.Ed.2d 641 (1980), the Supreme Court held that attorney fees may be recovered against an official under 42 U.S.C. 1988 when prospective relief is properly awarded against the official.
7 The Court found, on the basis of the legislative history of 1988 , that Congress intended for attorney fees to be awarded under 1988 to claimants who obtain prospective relief against an official but who otherwise are barred from recovering damages against the official.
Id. Indeed, the House Report states: 1988 17 H.R.Rep.No.1558, 94th Cong., 2nd Sess.
9 (1976).
8 We hold, therefore, that a prevailing party may recover attorney fees against a judicial official under 42 U.S.C. 1988 when prospective relief is properly awarded against the official.
See Morrison v. Ayoob , 627 F.2d 669, 672-73 (3d Cir. 1980), cert. denied , 449 U.S. 1102 , 101 S.Ct. 898 , 66 L.Ed.2d 828 (1981); Entertainment Concepts, Inc. v. Maciejewski , 631 F.2d 497, 507 (7th Cir. 1980), cert. denied , 450 U.S. 919 , 101 S.Ct. 1366 , 67 L.Ed.2d 346 (1981).
Because prospective relief was properly awarded against Magistrate Pulliam, see Timmerman v. Brown , 528 F.2d 811, 814 (4th Cir. 1975), rev'd on other grounds sub.
nom.
Leeke v. Timmerman , 454 U.S. 83 , 102 S.Ct. 69 , 70 L.Ed.2d 65 (1981), Allen was entitled to an award of attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. 1988 .
III.
Magistrate Pulliam further contends that the amount of attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. 1988 was excessive.
We disagree.
This court has recognized that the allowance of attorney fees "'is within the judicial discretion of the trial judge, who has close and intimate knowledge of the efforts expended and the value of the services rendered.
And an appellate court is not warranted in overturning the trial court's judgment unless under all of the facts and circumstances it is clearly wrong.'"
Barber v. Kimbrell's, Inc. , 577 F.2d 216, 226 (4th Cir. 1978) (quoting United States v. Anglin & Stevenson , 145 F.2d 622, 630 (10th Cir. 1944), cert. denied , 324 U.S. 844 , 65 S.Ct. 678 , 89 L.Ed. 1405 (1945)).
The facts and circumstances to be considered by the district court in determining reasonable attorney fees include: Barber v. Kimbrell's, Inc. , 577 F.2d 216, 226 n.28 (4th Cir. 1978).
Because we recognized that "merely providing a checklist of factors to consider does not lead to consistent results or, in many cases, reasonable fees," we articulated a method for applying these factors in Anderson v. Morris , 658 F.2d 246, 249 (4th Cir. 1981) (quoting Northcross v. Board of Education of Memphis City Schools , 611 F.2d 624, 642 (6th Cir. 1979)).
The district court initially should multiply the number of hours reasonably expended ("time and labor expended") by the customary hourly rate ("customary fee for like work") to establish a preliminary amount for the fee award.
The court then should consider the other factors and adjust the fee accordingly.
658 F.2d at 249 .
In this case, the district court reviewed each of the twelve factors and determined that the $7,308.00 attorney fee requested by Allen was "modest" in light of the fact that the case was novel, involved serious constitutional questions, was skillfully presented by counsel, and was taken on a contingency basis.
9 We have reviewed the record and conclude that, under all the facts and circumstances, the attorney fee awarded by the district court in this case was entirely reasonable.
Accordingly, the district court's award of attorney fees is affirmed.
IV.
For the foregoing reasons, the award of attorney fees by the district court is affirmed.
