 RUTH BADER GINSBURG , Circuit Judge: This case arises out of an air disaster and raises turbulent federal questions.
On September 1, 1983, Korean Air Lines (KAL) Flight 007, a commercial craft departing from Kennedy Airport in New York and bound for Seoul, South Korea, was destroyed over the Sea of Japan by Soviet Union military aircraft.
Wrongful death actions were filed against KAL in several federal district courts; the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred these actions to the District Court for the District of Columbia for pretrial proceedings pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1407 ("[C]ivil actions involving one or more common questions of fact pending in different districts may be transferred to any district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.").
The nub of the controversy relates to the per passenger damage limitation of the Warsaw Convention, 1 raised to $75,000 by an accord among airlines known as the Montreal Agreement.
2 By motion for partial summary judgment, plaintiffs sought a declaration "that [KAL] is liable without fault for compensatory damages without any limitation of $75,000."
Joint Appendix (J.A.)
at 26.
Plaintiffs grounded this motion on the inadequate type size of the liability limitation notice printed on KAL passenger tickets.
The notice appeared in 8 point type; the Montreal Agreement specifies 10 point type.
Denying plaintiffs' motion, the district court, on July 25, 1985, held that KAL could avail itself of the $75,000 per passenger limitation.

1463 , 19 Av.L.Rep.
(CCH) 17,584 (D.D.C.1985).
In so ruling, the district court considered and rejected contrary Second Circuit precedent: In re Air Crash Disaster at Warsaw, Poland, on March 14, 1980 , 705 F.2d 85 (2d Cir.), cert. denied , 464 U.S. 845 , 104 S.Ct. 147 , 78 L.Ed.2d 138 (1983).
On September 24, 1985, the district court certified for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1292(b) the question whether KAL "is entitled to avail itself of the limitation of damages provided by the Warsaw Convention and Montreal Agreement despite its defective tickets."
We ruled that the requirements of section 1292(b) were met and that "wise exercise of our discretion dictates that the appeal be allowed."
D.C.Cir.
Order filed April 8, 1986.
On January 30, 1987, after argument of the appeal, we remanded the record for clarification of the scope of the district court's order denying plaintiffs' partial summary judgment motion.
Specifically, [**41] we observed that the cases consolidated in this appeal Van Dusen v. Barrack 376 U.S. 612 84 S.Ct. 805 11 L.Ed.2d 945 28 U.S.C. 1407 D.C.Cir.
Order filed January 30, 1987.
By Memorandum dated May 7, 1987, 664 F.Supp.
1488 , the district court held that its July 25, 1985 decision denying plaintiffs' partial summary judgment motion applies to all three categories of cases described in this court's January 30, 1987 remand-for-clarification order.
We now affirm the district court's dispositions.
On the Warsaw Convention/Montreal Agreement $75,000 per passenger damage limitation issue, we adopt as our opinion the comprehensive July 25, 1985 decision of the district court, reported at 664 F.Supp.
1463 .
We set out below our reasons for concluding that the district court properly adhered to its own interpretation of the Warsaw Convention/Montreal Agreement in all actions, including those transferred from district courts within the Second Circuit.
The Supreme Court, in Van Dusen v. Barrack , 376 U.S. 612 , 84 S.Ct. 805 , 11 L.Ed.2d 945 (1964), addressed and resolved this question: when a defendant in a diversity action moves for a venue transfer under 28 U.S.C. 1404(a) , 3 which state's law applies post-transfer?
The state law that would have applied in the transferor court adheres to the case, the Supreme Court held; in the Court's words, "with respect to state law," the venue change will accomplish "but a change of courtrooms."
Van Dusen , 376 U.S. at 639 , 84 S.Ct. at 821 .
4 The Van Dusen interpretation of 28 U.S.C. 1404(a) , as the latter applies in diversity actions, rests on principles advanced in Erie R.R. v. Tompkins , 304 U.S. 64 , 58 S.Ct. 817 , 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), and cases in the Erie line.
Van Dusen , 376 U.S. at 637-40 , 84 S.Ct. at 819-21 ; see particularly Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co. , 313 U.S. 487 , 61 S.Ct. 1020 , 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941) (on issues of state law arising in diversity cases, federal courts must apply choice-of-law rules of states in which they sit).
Justice Goldberg explained for the Court in Van Dusen : 1404(a) Erie [**42] Erie 1404(a) Van Dusen , 376 U.S. at 637-39 , 84 S.Ct. at 820 (footnotes omitted).
Defendants in Van Dusen sought to transfer the case from the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to the District of Massachusetts.
(Massachusetts, but not Pennsylvania, limited the damages plaintiffs could recover.)
Were the transfer to be made, the Supreme Court ruled, though all further proceedings would take place in the Massachusetts district court, Pennsylvania law, not Massachusetts law, would furnish the governing state prescriptions.
The question before us is whether the Van Dusen rule--that the law applicable in the transferor forum attends the transfer--should apply to transferred federal claims.
It is a question meriting attention from Higher Authority.
Congress, it appears, has not focused on the issue, 5 nor has the Supreme Court addressed it.
The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation assumed, on at least one occasion, that the Van Dusen rule would apply to transferred federal claims, see In re Plumbing Fixtures Litigation , 342 F.Supp.
756, 758 (J.P.M.D.L.1972), 6 but the Panel, from what we can glean, has given the matter only fleeting consideration.
7 Recognizing that the question is perplexing, particularly in the context of 28 U.S.C. 1407 , a statute authorizing transfers only for pretrial purposes, we are persuaded by thoughtful commentary that "the transferee court [should] be free to decide a federal claim in the manner it views as correct without deferring to the interpretation of the transferor circuit."
Marcus, Conflict Among Circuits and Transfers Within the Federal Judicial System , 93 Y ALE L.J. 677, 721 (1984); see also Steinman, Law of the Case: A Judicial Puzzle in Consolidated and Transferred Cases and in Multidistrict Litigation , 135 U.P A. L.R EV.
595, 662-706 (1987).
As the district court stressed in response to our remand, the Erie policies served by the Van Dusen decision do not figure in the calculus when the law to be applied is federal, not state.
Given the reality of conflict among the circuits on the proper interpretation of federal law, however, why [**43] deny to a plaintiff with a federal claim the "venue privilege" a diversity claimant enjoys?
Plaintiffs in the Van Dusen situation could effectively pick Pennsylvania rather than Massachusetts law and retain the benefit of that choice after transfer.
Why deny a similar right of selection and retention to plaintiffs who would fare better under the Second Circuit's interpretation of federal law than under the D.C.Circuit's interpretation?
The point has been cogently made that venue provisions are designed with geographical convenience in mind, and not to "guarantee that the plaintiff will be able to select the law that will govern the case." Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno , 454 U.S. 235, 257 n. 24, 102 S.Ct. 252, 266 n. 24, 70 L.Ed.2d 419 (1981); see Marcus, supra , 93 Y ALE L.J. at 696-701.
In diversity cases, however, federal courts are governed by Klaxon and therefore may not compose federal choice-of-law principles; instead, they must look to state prescriptions in determining which state's law applies.
With "no federal choice-of-law principles that favor the application of the law of one state over the law of another," the diversity plaintiff's opening move or "venue privilege" ordinarily fills the gap--it "prevails by default."
Marcus, supra , 93 Y ALE L.J. at 700-01.
For the adjudication of federal claims, on the other hand, "[t]he federal courts comprise a single system [in which each tribunal endeavors to apply] a single body of law," H.L.
Green Co. v. MacMahon , 312 F.2d 650, 652 (2d Cir.1962), cert. denied , 372 U.S. 928 , 83 S.Ct. 876 , 9 L.Ed.2d 736 (1963); there is no compelling reason to allow plaintiff to capture the most favorable interpretation of that law simply and solely by virtue of his or her right to choose the place to open the fray.
As summarized in the commentary we find persuasive: Van Dusen Klaxon .

406, 412 (1972) ("I take [ Van Dusen ] to be limited to choices of state law.")
(emphasis in original).
Application of Van Dusen in the matter before us, we emphasize, would not produce uniformity.
There would be one interpretation of federal law for the cases initially filed in districts within the Second Circuit, and an opposing interpretation for cases filed elsewhere.
Applying divergent interpretations of the governing federal law to plaintiffs, depending solely upon where they initially filed suit, would surely reduce the efficiencies achievable through consolidated preparatory proceedings.
Indeed, because there is ultimately a single proper interpretation of federal law, the attempt to ascertain and apply diverse circuit interpretations simultaneously is inherently self-contradictory.
Our system contemplates differences between different states' laws; thus a multidistrict judge asked to apply divergent state positions on a point of law would face a coherent, if sometimes difficult, task.
But it is logically inconsistent to require one judge to apply simultaneously different and conflicting [**44] interpretations of what is supposed to be a unitary federal law. 8 The district judge in the instant case observed that May 7, 1987 D.D.C.

We agree.
The federal courts spread across the country owe respect to each other's efforts and should strive to avoid conflicts, but each has an obligation to engage independently in reasoned analysis.
Binding precedent for all is set only by the Supreme Court, and for the district courts within a circuit, only by the court of appeals for that circuit.
We return, finally, to the most anomalous feature of this case. As earlier observed, we deal here not with an "all-purpose" transfer under 28 U.S.C. 1404(a) , but with a transfer under 28 U.S.C. 1407 "for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings."
We have held, in accord with the district court, that the law of a transferor forum on a federal question--here, the law of the Second Circuit--merits close consideration, but does not have stare decisis effect in a transferee forum situated in another circuit.
Should the several cases consolidated for pretrial preparation in the instant proceeding eventually return to transferor courts outside this circuit, 9 would our district court's Warsaw Convention/Montreal Agreement ruling, which we have affirmed, have binding force?
We believe it should, as "law of the case," for if it did not, transfers under 28 U.S.C. 1407 could be counterproductive, i.e. , capable of generating rather than reducing the duplication and protraction Congress sought to check.
See Steinman, supra , 135 U.P A. L.R EV.
at 664-67, 700-704.
On this issue in the case at hand, however, our circuit is not positioned to speak the last word.
We affirm the order of the district court that KAL is entitled to avail itself of the limitation on damages provided by the Warsaw Convention and raised to $75,000 by the Montreal Agreement; and we note again that the proper interpretation of the Convention and Agreement, as well as the scope of the transferee court's interpretive authority in a case such as this one, are matters in need of definitive resolution for our national court system.
