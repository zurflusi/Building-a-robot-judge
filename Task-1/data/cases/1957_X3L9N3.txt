 PER CURIAM.
On a trial before the court without a jury, the appellant was convicted of knowingly having in possession an unregistered still in violation of Section 5601 , Title 26, United States Code, making and fermenting mash in violation of Section 5216 of said Title, possessing 413 gallons of nontaxpaid distilled spirits in violation of Section 5008 of said Title, and of working in an unregistered distillery in violation of Section 5681 of said Title.
The sole insistence on error goes to the overruling by the district court of the appellant's motion to suppress.
The findings of fact made by the court after hearing the evidence are not attacked.
In our opinion, those findings warranted, indeed required, the conclusions of law reached by the court and the overruling of the motion to suppress.
Since such findings and conclusions have not previously been published, they are attached as an Exhibit to this opinion.
The judgment is Affirmed.
