 EDWARDS , Circuit Judge.
The question posed by this case is whether a federally indicted Tennessee State Senator is entitled to the protection of a common law speech or debate privilege as to his legislative acts.
The issue requires an examination of a good deal of ancient history.
In 1689, after nearly two centuries of struggle between the English monarchy and the English Parliament, the English Bill of Rights was wrung by Parliament from newly crowned monarchs.
It declared "that the Freedom of Speech and Debate or Proceedings in Parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parliament."
1 It was the Constitution of the United States by adoption of the Bill of Rights in 1789 which first provided an enforceable guarantee of freedom of speech for all persons.
But previously in 1787 the original Constitution (and the Articles of Confederation before it 2 ) had enacted freedom of speech rights for members of Congress in the discharge of their official duties.
Article I, 6 of the United States Constitution provided (and provides) "any Speech or Debate in either House .
.
.
shall not be questioned in any other Place."
Three states in 1787 had already adopted similar protections for their legislators.
By now 43 states, including Tennessee, provide such constitutional protection for the legislative process.
The working of the Tennessee Constitutional guarantee is: Privilege of members Tenn.Const.
art.
II, 13 .
All parties to this litigation concede, however, that neither provision quoted above from either the United States or the Tennessee Constitutions is directly applicable to the instant prosecution.
This indictment is laid under a federal statute which prohibits "extortion .
.
.
under color of official right."
Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. 1951 (1976).
3 The Tennessee Constitution cannot provide any specific protection to this state legislator in this case because of the supremacy clause in the federal constitution, art.
VI, clause 2.
Of course, the United States Constitution's provision does not apply directly, since appellee is not a member of either house of the United States Congress.
The question which remains is whether a federal common law privilege for state legislators essentially equivalent to the provisions contained in the English Bill of Rights and the United States and Tennessee Constitutions should be recognized by the federal courts in admitting evidence in a Hobbs Act case.
If so, there is a second and less important question pertaining to the scope of the privilege to be applied in this case. THE FACTS The seven-count indictment against Tennessee State Senator Edgar H. Gillock charged him with 1) procuring and agreeing to accept a bribe "under color of official right" for using his official office to prevent the extradition of one James Williams from Tennessee to Illinois; 2) attempting to obtain $5,000 apiece from four named individuals for using his office to attempt to procure for them master electrician's licenses; and 3) being engaged in the racketeering enterprises referred to, in violation of TCA 39-802 which prohibits a member of the Tennessee legislature from agreeing to accept anything of value for exercising the discretion of the public office which he holds.
This case has been the subject of numerous motions and proceedings in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.
In those proceedings defendant Gillock moved to dismiss the indictment and to suppress all the evidence concerning his legislative activities.
The District Court denied motions to dismiss the indictment, but granted motions to exclude much of the evidence, holding that, as state senator, defendant Gillock had an evidentiary speech or debate privilege under Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence .
The government then appealed to this court under 18 U.S.C. 3731 (1976), and this court remanded for the writing of a more particularized record of the evidence to be dealt with.
In the District Court the government filed a detailed offer of proof which we have reproduced as an Appendix to this opinion.
The District Judge then made detailed rulings thereon, and on the same grounds, suppressed many items in the offer of proof.
The government then brought the instant appeal under 18 U.S.C. 3731 (1976).
THE PRIVILEGE The basic question, as the District Judge recognized, is whether or not defendant Gillock is entitled to a common-law speech or debate privilege.
Although the question has divided the Circuit Courts and has never been passed on by the Supreme Court, we hold that he is so entitled, albeit we would describe its limits somewhat more narrowly than did the District Judge.
The long history of the legislative speech or debate clauses which we have described at the beginning of this opinion forms the background of our decision.
The government's brief seems to suggest that there is no need for such protection of legislative branches of government (whether national or state) when the powers of government are divided (as in the United States and Tennessee Constitutions) between three co-equal bodies--the Executive, the Legislative and the Judiciary.
This argument would have more appeal if American history demonstrated that no national or state executive had ever reached for power so as to infringe upon the rights of a legislative branch.
From the beginning of the history of the United States to very recent years, however, there have been recurrent conflicts over power which have brought the President and Congress (to say nothing of Governors and Legislatures) into grave conflict.
It is easy to conceive of the abuse of federal prosecutorial power against members of state legislatures of an opposite political persuasion.
The problem of this case is not constitutional immunity.
No constitutional protection applies to defendant Gillock in this federal prosecution.
What is at issue is his claim, upheld by the District Judge, that evidence concerning his legislative acts should be suppressed because they are protected by a common-law privilege.
Chief Judge Bailey Brown who conducted the hearings and entered the suppression order from which this appeal is taken reasoned as follows: Brewster We believe that under the historical background we have recited above, Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence authorized Judge Brown (and authorizes and requires us) to find and protect a speech or debate privilege.
Rule 501 provides: We have indicated above that lessons "of reason and experience" have motivated recognition of legislative speech or debate immunity or privilege in 43 of the 50 states and in the English Bill of Rights, the Articles of Confederation of the United States, as well as the United States Constitution.
While the United States Supreme Court has never passed upon the precise problem which we face, it has recognized the immunity from civil suit of a state legislator on reasoning which we think applicable to this case: Stockdale v. Hansard 6 Tenney v. Brandhove 341 U.S. 367, 372-73 71 S.Ct. 783, 786 95 L.Ed. 1019 In the fundamental case dealing with the protection granted by the United States Constitution's provision for protection of speech or debate, the Supreme Court, through Chief Justice Burger said: United States v.

Eastland , 387 U.S. 82, 84 , 87 S.Ct. 1425 , 18 L.Ed.2d 577 (1967).
By citing these Supreme Court cases, we do not suggest that any one of them supplies precisely controlling law as to our present case. The Courts of Appeals do supply well-argued opinions on both sides of the general question we confront here: United States v. Craig , 528 F.2d 773 (7th Cir.), cert. denied , 425 U.S. 973 , 96 S.Ct. 2171 , 48 L.Ed.2d 796 (1976) [ Craig I ]; United States v. Craig , 537 F.2d 957 (7th Cir.) (en banc) [ Craig II ], cert. denied sub nom.

While we respect the views of the judges in the Seventh and First Circuits who have rejected the existence of a common law speech or debate privilege, we feel, as did the Seventh Circuit dissenters and the Third Circuit majority, that the long history and the felt need for protection of legislative speech or debate and the repeated and strong recognition of that history in the cases we have cited from the Supreme Court, fully justify our affirming Chief Judge Brown in his protection of the privilege in this case.
We should also comment upon the government's argument in terrorem that for the federal courts to recognize the speech or debate privilege for this Tennessee State Senator would open the door to similar claims on behalf of members of lesser legislative bodies like city councils and county boards.
This opinion, however, affords no basis for such an extension.
Nor will it until and unless a history of "reason and experience" within the meaning of Rule 501 can be cited, which includes recognition of a speech or debate immunity or privilege for city councilmen or county board members in the constitutions of a large majority of the states of the union.
This record and our research do not indicate that any state has as yet granted such recognition.
THE EXTENT OF THE PRIVILEGE Since we affirm the District Judge in holding that Gillock is entitled to a common law speech or debate privilege, we turn to the question also posed in this appeal as to the extent of the privilege.
The District Court suppressed Items 3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 (found in the Appendix) and the governor's veto letter, infra .
The government concedes that if the privilege is recognized, Items 9, 11, and 13, which deal directly with Gillock's legislative activity are correctly excluded.
It, however, claims that the following items are not part of the legislative process and hence should be admitted at trial: Item No. 3: Item No. 8: Item No. 12: The proof would show that the individuals who had met with the defendant to urge him to withdraw the legislation, and others, then contacted the Governor, explained their opposition to the Governor, and explained the defendant's position to the Governor.
On April 3, 1972, the Governor vetoed Senate Bill 1783.
(A copy of the veto message is attached as Exhibit M.) We believe that the extent of the privilege granted in this case must be measured by the Supreme Court's views on the extent of immunity granted by the United States Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause, since the values protected by each are basically identical.
Having said this does not, however, easily resolve the question of the admissibility of the four items above.
While there is broad general language in older cases dealing with the clause, in more recent cases the Supreme Court majority has narrowed the immunity granted to members of Congress.
In 1881, in the first case in which the Supreme Court construed the Speech or Debate Clause, it held that immunity extended to all "things generally done in a session of [Congress] by one of its members in relation to the business before it."
Kilbourn v. Thompson , 103 U.S. 168, 204 , 26 L.Ed. 377 (1881).
This broad standard could arguably extend immunity to almost any act of a Congressman "relating to" the exercise of his powers of office, providing only that similar acts were "generally done" by other members of Congress.
In 1966, however, the Supreme Court held that the Constitutional immunity did not apply to prosecutions which do not "draw in question the legislative acts of the defendant member of Congress or his motives for performing them."
United States v. Johnson , 383 U.S. 169, 185 , 86 S.Ct. 749, 758 , 15 L.Ed.2d 681 (1966).
The Court added: United States v. Johnson supra at 172 86 S.Ct. at 751 Then in 1972, Chief Justice Burger, writing for a majority of six, specifically narrowed the interpretation which might otherwise be placed on earlier cases: Kilbourn v. Thompson supra, at 204 Coffin v. Coffin 4 Mass. 1, 27 relating due 10 10 See Kilbourn v. Thompson , 103 U.S. 168 , 26 L.Ed. 377 (1881) (voting for a resolution); Tenney v. Brandhove , 341 U.S. 367 , 71 S.Ct. 783 , 95 L.Ed. 1019 (1951) (harassment of witness by state legislator during a legislative hearing; not a Speech or Debate Clause case); United States v. Johnson , 383 U.S. 169 , 86 S.Ct. 749 , 15 L.Ed.2d 681 (1966) (making a speech on House floor); Dombrowski v. Eastland , 387 U.S. 82 , 87 S.Ct. 1425 , 18 L.Ed.2d 577 (1967) (subpoenaing records for committee hearing); Powell v. McCormack , 395 U.S. 486 , 89 S.Ct. 1944 , 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969) (voting for a resolution).
In Coffin v. Coffin , 4 Mass. 1 (1808), the state equivalent of the Speech or Debate Clause was held to be inapplicable to a legislator who was acting outside of his official duties.
United States v. Brewster 408 U.S. 501, 512-13, 515-16 92 S.Ct. at 2537 This view was still further spelled out in Gravel v. United States , 408 U.S. 606 , 92 S.Ct. 2614 , 33 L.Ed.2d 583 (1972), where a 5-4 Court held that Senator Gravel's arrangement to publish the Pentagon Papers was not protected by the Speech or Debate Clause: United States v. Doe 455 F.2d , at 760 6 Gravel v. United States supra at 625-26 92 S.Ct. at 2627 See also Eastland v. United States Servicemen's Fund , 421 U.S. 491 , 95 S.Ct. 1813 , 44 L.Ed.2d 324 (1975); Doe v. McMillan , 412 U.S. 306 , 93 S.Ct. 2018 , 36 L.Ed.2d 912 (1973); Powell v. McCormack , 395 U.S. 486 , 89 S.Ct. 1944 , 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969), and Dombrowski v. Eastland , 387 U.S. 82 , 87 S.Ct. 1425 , 18 L.Ed.2d 577 (1967).
Our review of these cases convinces us that only one of the four items which we deal with in this section should have been suppressed.
That one is Item 3(a), supra --Gillock's request for an opinion as to the constitutionality of extradition for a misdemeanor.
Even though there was no specific legislation at that time authorizing a legislator to make such a request, see TCA 8-609(6) (1973 ed. & 1977 Cum.Supp.
), this request directly related to the legislative process.
As to Items 8, 12 and the Governor's veto message, we believe they are admissible under the standards of United States v. Brewster , supra , and later cases.
Gillock has no right to claim his speech or debate privilege as to the Governor's exercise of the gubernatorial right of veto.
Items 8 and 12 appear to us to be well outside of the ambit of legislative activity.
For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is modified by our ruling that Items 8, 12 and the Governor's veto message are admissible and in all other respects is affirmed.
