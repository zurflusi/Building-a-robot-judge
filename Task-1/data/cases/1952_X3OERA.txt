 PER CURIAM.
Complaining of a search and seizure made in connection with his arrest at 4910 Alameda Avenue, El Paso, Texas, appellant, petitioner below, filed a petition for the return of seized property and the suppression of its use as evidence against him in any criminal proceeding.
The matter having come on for hearing and been fully heard, the district judge, upon evidence which came in without dispute that the search and seizure was not unreasonable, entered an order 1 denying the petition and this appeal followed.
2 Here insisting that the search, though made in connection with his lawful arrest was not such a mere incidental search as under the applicable authorities 3 is reasonable, but was of the general exploratory kind which is forbidden, appellant, invoking Boyd v. U. S. , 116 U.S. 616, 623 , 6 S.Ct. 544 , 29 L.Ed. 746 ; Agnello v. U. S. , 269 U.S. 20 , 46 S.Ct. 4 , 70 L.Ed. 145 , and Go-Bart Importing Co. v. U. S. , 282 U.S. 344 , 51 S.Ct. 153 , 75 L.Ed. 374 , urges upon us that the judgment was erroneous and must be reversed.
We do not think so.
We are fully mindful of the statement in the majority opinion, in U. S. v. Rabinowitz , 339 U.S., at page 66 , 70 S.Ct. at page 435 , 94 L.Ed. 653 : and of the solemn warnings set down so carefully in the minority opinion.
Mindful also that reasonableness is in the first instance for the district judge to determine, we are of the opinion that the record furnishes us no basis for disregarding his finding and conclusion on that issue.
The order appealed from is Affirmed.
