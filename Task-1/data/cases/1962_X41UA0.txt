 RIVES , Circuit Judge.
The question for decision is whether a federal district court has jurisdiction to extend by injunction the statutory seven-month period of rate suspension in a proceeding still pending before the Interstate Commerce Comission.
The plaintiffs, appellants, Arrow Transportation Company et al., seek to enjoin the four defendants, appellee Railroad Companies, from applying to the rail transportation of grain certain railroad tariff schedules published by them and which are currently under investigation by the Interstate Commerce Commission in Docket No. I. & S. 7656, Grain in Multiple Car Shipments--River Crossings to the South.
This appeal is from an order of the district court denying the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction solely on the ground that it had no jurisdiction of the subject matter.
The complaint based federal jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C.A. 1332 ; on the existence of a federal question, 28 U.S.C.A. 1331 ; and on the Clayton Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C.A. 12 et seq., and 28 U.S.C.A. 1337 .
The district court found the general jurisdictional averments as to diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy to be true.
It further found that during 1961 the defendants published tariff schedules proposing to reduce substantially their rates and charges on the transportation of grain in multiple car shipments from certain Ohio and Mississippi River ports to numerous destinations in the Southeast.
Its further findings of fact, conclusions of law and order are expressed so clearly and succinctly that they had best be quoted: Section 15(7) 49 U.S.C. 15(7) "CONCLUSIONS OF LAW Section 15(7) Section 6 of the Interstate Commerce Act ( 49 U.S.C.A. 6 ) provides that rates and charges for transportation shall be initiated and published by the carrier and shall not be changed except after thirty days notice to the Commission unless the Commission, in its discretion and for good cause shown, allows changes upon less notice.
The section most pertinent to the present appeal is Section 15 , paragraph (7): Commission to determine lawfulness of new rates; suspension; refunds 49 U.S.C.A. 15 The Act seems to us to be a model of clarity.
It is of course elementary that the power to prescribe rates to be charged in the future is a legislative function.

Though not so frequently declared in the decisions, it would seem equally clear that the power to suspend or not to suspend rates involves a determination of what the rates shall be during the suspension period, which frequently extends over months and years, and is itself a legislative function.
See Board of Railroad Com'rs v. Great Northern Ry. , 1930, 281 U.S. 412, 429, 430 , 50 S.Ct. 391 , 74 L.Ed. 936 ; 1 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, 7.08 , p. 442; 9 Am.Jur.
Carriers, 65 , p. 472.
The Congress, in its wisdom, has permitted carriers to initiate their own schedule of rates subject to the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission to determine the lawfulness of such rates.
Pending the Commission's hearing for such purpose, it may suspend the operation of the rate schedule "but not for a longer period than seven months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect."
49 U.S.C.A. 15(7) .
Some irreparable injury appears unavoidable in the process of establishing new rates.
If the new rates are ultimately determined to be just, reasonable, and lawful, the carriers and that portion of the public which would benefit from the change in rates have nonetheless suffered irreparable injury during the period of suspension.
If the period of suspension has expired and the new rate schedule goes into effect, but is subsequently determined to be unlawful, then competing carriers and that portion of the public which would suffer because of the change in rates has been injured during the period when the rates were not suspended, and in many cases that injury is irreparable.
In case of increased rates, the Commission may require refunds.
Experience has proved that such power to require refunds is itself an inadequate and unsatisfactory remedy, but even that remedy is unavailable in the case of reduced rates.
Prior to the Act carriers were at liberty to establish and maintain even unreasonably low rates provided they were not discriminatory.

If cheap rates are monopolistic or in restraint of trade, and are the result of a combination or conspiracy among carriers, 1 the Government has adequate civil and criminal remedies under the Antitrust Act.
Keogh v. Chicago & N. W. Ry. Co. , supra .
Section 16 of the Clayton Act, however, clearly stands in the way of private injunctive relief.
sections 13 Provided sections 12 15 U.S.C.A. 26 The Supreme Court has declared: United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Ass'n 166 U.S. 290 17 S.Ct. 540 41 L.Ed. 1007 United States v. Joint Traffic Ass'n 171 U.S. 505 19 S.Ct. 25 43 L.Ed. 259 General Investment Co. v. New York Central R. Co. 271 U.S. 228 46 S.Ct. 496 70 L.Ed. 920 Central Transfer Co. v. Terminal R.R.
Ass'n , 1933, 288 U.S. 469, 474, 475 , 53 S.Ct. 444 , 77 L.Ed. 899 .
Section 8 of the Interstate Commerce Act appears to provide that the carriers would be liable in damages to the persons injured if the cheaper rates are ultimately declared unlawful: 49 U.S.C.A. 8 All of the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act are required to be administered and enforced with a view to carrying out the National Transportation Policy declared in the Act of September 18, 1940, c. 722, Title I, 1 , 54 Stat. 899 , 49 U.S.C.A. note preceding 1 : An unreasonably low rate found to be in violation of the National Transportation Policy would give rise to an action for damages under 49 U.S.C.A. 8 .
That such a finding may ultimately be reached after full hearing furnishes no authority to the Courts to extend the statutory seven-month period of rate suspension in the face of the clear mandate of the statute that, "if the proceeding has not been concluded and an order made within the period of suspension, the proposed change of rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation, or practice shall go into effect at the end of such period.
*" [ 49 U.S.C.A. 15(7) .]
Essentially the Court is asked to declare as to the present case that the seven-month period of suspension provided in the statute is inadequate.
If that can be done in this case, there is practically no end to the number of instances in which the courts will be called on to set aside the mandate of the statute.
Congress, in its wisdom, has fixed seven months as the maximum period of suspension.
It seems clear to us that if the courts extend that period, they are in effect amending the statute and that is a matter beyond their power.
We have given careful consideration to the excellent briefs of counsel on both sides and to those filed by amici curiae.
A further discussion of many pertinent authorities would be in order if time were not of the essence.
Since, however, this is a case where justice delayed would be justice denied, and we have no doubt of the soundness of our decision, we shall forego any further discussion.
Since Southern Railway Company has not appealed, we do not pass on that part of the judgment denying its motion to dismiss.
See 7 Moore's Federal Practice, 2nd ed., Sec. 72.05.
To afford the appellants a reasonable time to seek a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court, it is directed that the mandate of affirmance issue twenty-one days from the date of this decision.
See Fifth Circuit Rule 32, 28 U.S.C.A.
If during that period a petition for certiorari has been filed, prompt consideration will be given to any request for a further stay of the mandate.
See 28 U.S.C.A. 2101(f) ; Supreme Court Rule 18, 28 U.S.C.A. The judgment of the district court denying the motion for a preliminary injunction is affirmed.
Affirmed.
