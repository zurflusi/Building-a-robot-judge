 PER CURIAM.
We will affirm the judgment of the court below, 198 F.Supp.
548 , granting the motion by the defendants-appellees to dismiss the complaint.
We do so because the plaintiffs-appellants' contentions are totally devoid of merit.
The result we have reached renders it unnecessary for us to examine or discuss breaches of the Rules of Civil Procedure by the plaintiffs-appellants.
