 WEICK , Circuit Judge.
The indictment charged that appellant Barrett, having been convicted in the state court of a felony, housebreaking, knowingly received and had in his possession a firearm, towit, a .32 caliber Smith and Wesson revolver, which had been transported in interstate commerce, 18 U.S.C. 922(h).
He was tried and convicted by a jury and was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.
Barrett had purchased the revolver on April 1, 1972, in a Western Auto Store in Booneville, Kentucky.
Western Auto Store had received the gun on March 5, 1972 from Gastonia, North Carolina.
About one-half hour after Barrett had purchased the revolver he was observed by two deputy sheriffs driving his automobile south of Booneville.
After the officers chased his car a short distance he stopped, and they arrested him for driving while intoxicated.
One of the deputies then noticed the firearm on the floor board on the driver's side of Barrett's car; it was loaded.
Barrett had been convicted previously on January 17, 1967, of the housebreaking charge, and was sentenced to two years' imprisonment.
On June 20, 1969, after Barrett served his sentence, the Governor of Kentucky signed a partial pardon restoring Barrett only to his civil rights.
Barrett contended in the District Court and here that his purchase of the firearm from the dealer was an intrastate transaction, not within the scope of Section 922(h), and that, in any event the document which he received from the Governor of Kentucky constituted a full pardon and therefore his previous conviction had been wiped out.
I THE STATUTE Section 922(h) provides in relevant part: .
.
.
.
.
.
This section is part of Title IV of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.
It would appear to us that under the Government's proof this statute has been literally complied with.
The firearm indeed had been transported in interstate commerce, from North Carolina to Kentucky, less than one month before Barrett received it.
Barrett relies on dictum contained in the majority opinion in United States v. Bass , 404 U.S. 336 at 342-343 , 92 S.Ct. 515, 520 , 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971).
Bass involved a prosecution under Title VII of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, while the prosecution in the present case was under Title IV of the Act.
The dictum is as follows: 10 Tot v. United States 319 U.S. 463 63 S.Ct. 1241 87 L.Ed. 1519 Id., at 466 63 S.Ct., at 1244 e. g. 404 U.S. at 343 92 S.Ct. at 520 By reference to Tot , the complete sentence, of which the foregoing quotation is a part, is as follows: 319 U.S. at 466 63 S.Ct. at 1244 Tot Id. at 466 63 S.Ct. at 1244 It therefore appears that the Government conceded that the construction of the statute by the lower courts was correct, and that the Supreme Court accepted the concession without discussion.
In Tot all that the Court decided was that the presumptive provision in the Act was invalid.
In the present case the Government has made no such concession, and we are required to decide the issue.
Footnote 10 in Bass recognized that "the reach of Title IV itself is a question to be decided finally some other day .
.
.
."
1 It is our opinion that there is no ambiguity in Section 922(h) of the Act.
It means exactly what it says.
Barrett did indeed receive a firearm which had been transported in interstate commerce.
Such receipt violated the plain language of the statute.
It was not necessary for the Government to prove that Barrett received the firearm from the common carrier.
II THE PARDON It will be noted that Section 922(h) contains no exemption for any one who has been pardoned.
Barrett in the District Court relied on the exemption contained in 18 U.S.C. 1203 Appendix, which appears in 18 U.S.C. 3531 to End, page 496, and reads as follows: Section 1203 is part of Title VII of the Act and would not appear to apply to an indictment under Title IV of the Act.
But if the exemption did apply, it would not help Barrett because the alleged pardon did not authorize him to receive the ALL THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENSHIP [SEAL] /s/ Louie B. Nunn By the Governor All that the pardon purported to do was to restore "all civil rights lost by reason of conviction of a felony."
Section 77 of the Kentucky Constitution provides: In Herndon v. Commonwealth , 105 Ky. 197 at 200 , 48 S.W. 989 at 990 (1899), the Court quoted the following language taken from Mount v. Conn., 2 Duv., 93, with respect to a Section 77 pardon: The civil rights to which Barrett was restored by the pardon were the right to suffrage provided for in Section 145 of the Kentucky Constitution, the right to hold public office as provided in Section 150 of the Constitution, and the right to serve on a jury, provided in K.R.S.
29.025.
These constitutional and statutory provisions expressly state that their civil rights are restored by the pardon.
The differences between a pardon merely restoring civil rights and a pardon relieving a convict of the penalty are pointed out in Arnett v. Stumbo , 287 Ky. 433, 435-436 , 153 S.W.2d 889, 890 (1941), where the Court stated: 287 Ky. at 437 153 S.W.2d at 891 In Illinois Cent. R. R. v. Bosworth , 133 U.S. 92, 103 , 10 S.Ct. 231, 234 , 33 L.Ed. 550 (1890), the Supreme Court stated the effect of a full pardon: Ex parte Garland 4 Wall. 333, 380 18 L.Ed. 366 In 67 C.J.S.
Pardons 1b, at 562-563, the several kinds of pardons are discussed: It is clear to us that the pardon in the present case was not a full pardon, but only a partial pardon.
There was no remission of guilt, nor of the penalty.
The only thing accomplished by the pardon was a restoration of civil rights under Kentucky law.
The rule of United States v. Renner , 496 F.2d 922 (6th Cir., 1974), should be confined to the facts of that case. The present case involved a question of Kentucky law relating to pardons, and appellant is bound by Kentucky law.
Affirmed.
