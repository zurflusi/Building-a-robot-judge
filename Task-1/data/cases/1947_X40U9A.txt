 MATHEWS , Circuit Judge.
Appellant (Earl P. Hoiness) filed a libel in personam against appellees (the United States, the American South African Line, Incorporated, and others) in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of California.
The named appellees answered the libel.
The others did not answer and, so far as the record shows, were not served with process.
A trial was had.
Thereafter, without considering the evidence, the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction, and that the libel, therefore, should be dismissed.
These conclusions were stated by the court in an opinion filed on August 5, 1946.
1 Thereupon, on August 5, 1946, the court entered an order dismissing the libel.
2 The order of August 5, 1946, was a final decision, within the meaning of 128(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. 225(a), and was appealable, 3 but no appeal was taken therefrom.
The concluding sentence of the order of August 5, 1946, 4 directed appellees' counsel to submit findings of fact and conclusions of law.
There was no apparent reason for such a direction.
The court's conclusions of law were stated in its opinion.
5 If its conclusions were correct, no findings of fact were necessary, for its conclusions were based on the libel, not on the evidence.
No question of fact was considered or decided.
A document entitled "Findings of fact and conclusions of law" was filed on October 14, 1946.
6 An examination of the document reveals that the so-called findings stated therein were not findings of fact.
The stated conclusions were that the libel failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and that the court was "without jurisdiction to entertain the cause on the merits."
There was also filed on October 14, 1946, a so-called decree purporting to dismiss the libel which, in fact, was dismissed by the order of August 5, 1946.
7 From the so-called decree of October 14, 1946, this appeal was taken on October 18, 1946.
8 As heretofore stated, the order of August 5, 1946, was a final decision.
There was no other final decision in this case. No other final decision was necessary.
The so-called decree of October 14, 1946, was not a final decision and was not appealable.
9 Appeal dismissed.
