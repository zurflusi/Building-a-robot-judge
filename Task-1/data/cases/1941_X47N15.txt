 PER CURIAM.
The state of Georgia, through its Attorney General, brought this suit against American Bitumuls Co., Shell Oil Co., Inc., Emulsified Asphalt Refining Co., Hiram Wesley Evans, a dealer in emulsified asphalt and John W. Greer, Jr., purchasing agent for the State Highway Board of Georgia, to recover damages, alleging the parties named and others had engaged in a conspiracy to control the sale of emulsified asphalt throughout the United States, in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890, 15 U.S.C.A. 1-7, 15 note.
The complaint further alleged that the state of Georgia had been damaged in the amount of $128,027.13, through the payment of excessive prices for asphalt purchased.
The prayer was for recovery of $384,081.39.
Defendants moved to dismiss the suit on the ground that the state of Georgia is not a "person" entitled to bring such an action under the provisions of Sec. 7 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.A. 15.
The motions were granted and the suit dismissed.
The state of Georgia is a sovereign.
The case is controlled by the decision of the Supreme Court in United States v. Cooper Corporation , 312 U.S. 600 , 61 S.Ct. 742 , 85 L.Ed. 1071 .
On the authority of that decision the judgment is affirmed.
