 ERVIN , Circuit Judge: The Supreme Court has vacated our decision in Sharpe v. United States , 660 F.2d 967 (4th Cir.1981), and has remanded 1 this case to us, 457 U.S. 1127 , 102 S.Ct. 2951 , 73 L.Ed.2d 1345 (1982), with the direction that we reconsider it in light of United States v. Ross , 456 U.S. 798 , 102 S.Ct. 2157 , 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982).
We have now done so.
We conclude that by virtue of Ross , the decision of the Supreme Court in Robbins v. California , 453 U.S. 420 , 101 S.Ct. 2841 , 69 L.Ed.2d 744 (1981), upon which we relied as an alternative basis for our decision in Sharpe , is no longer valid.
Accordingly, we disavow the rationale set forth in Section IV of the majority opinion.
We also modify Section V of that opinion by deleting therefrom the words "either or because the warrantless search of the bales was unlawful."
Finding that Ross does not adversely affect our primary holding that the initial stop of the vehicle and the lengthy detention of the two defendants constituted illegal seizures, we readopt the majority opinion as modified herein, reaffirm our previous decision, and reverse the convictions.
I am authorized to state that Chief Judge HARRISON L. WINTER, a member of the original panel, and Circuit Judges JAMES DICKSON PHILLIPS, MURNAGHAN, and SPROUSE join in the views expressed in this opinion.
