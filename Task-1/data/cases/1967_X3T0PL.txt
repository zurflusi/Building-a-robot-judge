 SCHNACKENBERG , Circuit Judge.
Sam De Stefano, petitioner, appeals from an order of the district court entered January 31, 1967, dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, as amended, against Joseph I. Woods, Sheriff of Cook County, Illinois, respondent.
The case was disposed of by the court on the pleadings.
Petitioner was placed in the custody of respondent pursuant to a final order of the Appellate Court of Illinois, First District, People v. De Stefano , 64 Ill. App.2d 368 , 212 N.E.2d 368 (1965), cert. denied 385 U.S. 989 , 87 S.Ct. 594 , 17 L.Ed.2d 450 .
In three orders defendant had been found guilty of direct criminal contempts of court under the laws of Illinois for his conduct in open court during the trial of a criminal case against him, 1 in the Criminal Division of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois.
As revealed by the opinion of the Appellate Court, the conduct of defendant was appraised by that court, at 387-388, 212 N.E.2d at 379 : For his acts of contempt of court, defendant was sentenced to three concurrent one-year sentences in the county jail and, in addition, to one of the sentences a $2,000 fine was added.
This punishment was imposed at the close of the jury trial.
1.
In this court petitioner's counsel attacks on federal constitutional grounds the sentences imposed for contempt.
The attack upon these sentences is based upon the contention that their imposition violated the federal constitution, citing article III 2 , that "The Trial of all Crimes shall be by Jury; *", as well as the sixth amendment to the constitution.
Reliance is also placed on Cheff v. Schnackenberg , 384 U.S. 373 , 86 S.Ct. 1523 , 16 L.Ed.2d 629 (1966).
Respondent's counsel point out, however, that nothing said in Cheff indicates an intent to repudiate Green v. United States , 356 U.S. 165 , 78 S.Ct. 632 , 2 L.Ed.2d 672 (1958).
In Green , at 183, 78 S.Ct. at 642 , the court considered petitioner's constitutional arguments in that case, saying: infamous crime Mackin v. United States 117 U.S. 348 6 S.Ct. 777 29 L.Ed. 909 18 U.S.C. 4083 criminal contempts are not subject to jury trial as a matter of constitutional right Green was expressly followed in United States v. Barnett , 376 U.S. 681 , at 692, 84 S.Ct. 984, 990 , 12 L.Ed.2d 23 (1964), where the court said: both state and federal While we believe that the United States Supreme Court has made it clear that the federal constitution does not require a jury trial in a criminal contempt case, which is what is involved in the case at bar, counsel for petitioner here contends that Cheff has insured the right to a trial by jury under the federal constitution, even in a state court, when the sentence exceeds six months.
We disagree.
As we interpret Cheff , the court was there announcing a rule of procedure for federal courts.
It was not considering any state court proceeding.
Obviously the state court proceeding here involved is subject to the control of the state of Illinois and not to the federal court as to the procedure pursued in punishing for criminal contempts such as here involved.
2.
Furthermore, the record shows that, as a result of petitioner's repeated acts of misconduct in open court in utter disregard of the proper administration of the court's business, the court imposed three one-year sentences, but with indulgence provided that they should be served concurrently, altho it in addition imposed a fine of $2,000 as to one of the charges of contempt.
These facts contradict petitioner's charge that cruel and unusual punishment was imposed upon him in violation of the eighth amendment to the constitution of the United States.
In fact any less punishment would be an invitation to other such persons to vie with petitioner in more flagrant ways of showing their contempt for courts of law. 3.
Petitioner's counsel in this court urges as a ground for reversal that the record of the trial in the state court reflects such eratic behavior by petitioner during the trial that the trial court should have ordered a sanity hearing.
In the case at bar, the district court found "that there was not sufficiently called to the attention of the trial judge anything that would warrant a sanity hearing."
We agree.
In fact, we highly regard the opportunity of the trial judge to arrive at a correct appraisal of defendant, as he observed his conduct in court.
This record is quite different from that in Pate v. Robinson , 383 U.S. 375 , 86 S.Ct. 836 , 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966), where the evidence raised a sufficient doubt as to Robinson's competence to stand trial and, although the matter was called to the attention of the trial court by court-appointed counsel, defendant was convicted in an unduly hurried trial without a fair opportunity to obtain expert psychiatric testimony and without sufficient development of the facts on the issue of defendant's sanity when he committed the crime as well as his competence at the time of the trial.
In the case at bar the contemptuous conduct of petitioner as revealed by the record lacked any aspects of incompetence.
Thus nothing was required of either the presiding judge or anyone acting on behalf of petitioner to initiate a sanity hearing.
For these reasons, the order from which this appeal was taken is affirmed.
Order affirmed.
