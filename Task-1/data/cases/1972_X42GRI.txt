 PER CURIAM: Clifford H. Davis appeals from the denial by the District Court of his motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2255 .
We affirm.
Appellant was indicted by a federal grand jury sitting in Greenville, Mississippi, on January 30, 1968, for bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2113(a) .
He was tried by a jury, convicted and sentenced to serve fourteen years.
We affirmed on direct appeal.
See Davis v. United States , 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 1095 .
Appellant, a Negro, alleges for the first time in his 2255 petition that his sentence should be set aside on grounds of systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand jury which indicted him.
The District Court correctly found that appellant's failure to raise the objection timely by pretrial motion, pursuant to Rule 12(b) (2), Fed.R.Crim.P., constituted a waiver of that objection, and in the absence of any extraordinary or prejudicial circumstances, appellant was not entitled to the relief sought.
See Shotwell Manufacturing Co. v. United States , 371 U.S. 341 , 83 S.Ct. 448 , 9 L.Ed.2d 357 (1963); Pinkney v. United States , 5 Cir., 1967, 380 F.2d 882 ; Jackson v. United States , 5 Cir., 1968, 394 F.2d 114 ; Brooks v. United States , 5 Cir., 1969, 416 F.2d 1044 ; Bustillo v. United States , 5 Cir., 1970, 421 F.2d 131 ; Throgmartin v. United States , 5 Cir., 1970, 424 F.2d 630 .
There is no merit to appellant's additional contention that his constitutional rights were infringed because an assistant to his counsel, a senior law school student, was not allowed to confer with him in prison.
Affirmed.
ON PETITION FOR REHEARING It is ordered that the petition for rehearing filed in the above entitled and numbered cause be and the same is hereby denied.
