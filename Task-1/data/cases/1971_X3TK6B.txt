 EDWARDS , Circuit Judge.
In this case we are asked by the State of Tennessee to review and reverse the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus sought by petitioner Biggers in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.
After a full hearing and after review of the full record of the proceedings in the state courts of Tennessee wherein Biggers had been convicted of rape and sentenced to 20 years in Tennessee's State Vocational Training School, the District Judge found that identification procedures employed by Nashville police and subsequently made the subject of extensive testimony at trial had been so essentially unfair as to represent a deprivation of appellant's federal constitutional right to due process of law.
He ordered Tennessee either to retry appellant or release him.
The District Court found the facts pertinent to issuance of the writ as follows: 1 "1.
There is considerable doubt on reading the trial record as to whether or not Mrs. Beamer made a positive in-court identification of petitioner at the time of the trial."
The District Judge reviewed this record on a legal standard recently reiterated by the United States Supreme Court in language which is directly applicable here: United States v. Wade 388 U.S. 218 87 S.Ct. 1926 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 Gilbert v. California 388 U.S. 263 87 S.Ct. 1951 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 Stovall v. Denno 388 U.S. 293 87 S.Ct. 1967 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 Wade Gilbert Id .

The only other eye-witness, Mrs. Beamer's daughter could not identify Biggers.

Simmons v. United States supra 390 U.S. 377 88 S.Ct. 967 19 L.Ed.2d 1214 Chapman v. California 386 U.S. 18 87 S.Ct. 824 17 L.Ed.2d 705 Biggers v. Tennessee supra at 409 390 U.S. 404 88 S.Ct. 979 19 L.Ed.2d 1267 We too have reviewed the state trial court record and the appellate record above that, as well as the somewhat different transcript developed in the testimony before the District Judge.
We believe the record does not allow us to find that the conclusions of fact of the District Judge are clearly erroneous.
In addition, we find no error in the District Judge's understanding of the principles of due process of law as they apply to identification proceedings prior to decision of the Wade 1 , Gilbert 2 cases.
Normally this would mean affirmance of the judgment on the careful opinion written by Judge Miller 3 in the court below.
What divides our panel, however, is the effect of the direct appeal proceedings which preceded the instant federal habeas corpus case. These included affirmance of appellant Biggers' conviction by the Supreme Court of Tennessee, a grant of certiorari by the United States Supreme Court, and the subsequent affirmance of the decision of the Supreme Court of Tennessee by an equally divided vote of the membership of the United States Supreme Court.
Our brother finds in the appellate proceedings which culminated with a 4-4 affirmance by the United States Supreme Court a final adjudication of all due process issues arising out of the pretrial identification measures employed in relation to appellant Biggers.
As we understand the matter, he regards the 4-4 vote as the expression of a final federal view upon the critical due process question involved in this appeal, and believes that it precluded the District Judge from entertaining, taking testimony on, or making findings of fact in relation to the pretrial identification process in the course of appellant Biggers' petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus.
There are three reasons which compel our disagreement: First, the District Judge decided a different question than that which had been presented to the United States Supreme Court on certiorari.
The question upon which certiorari was granted as stated in the Application for Certiorari was: voice identification impartial identification of his voice As is clear from the quotation below from Judge Miller's opinion, he expressly did not decide the effect of the voice identification, except perhaps as a portion of "the totality of circumstances" of an impermissibly suggestive show-up: While obviously four members of the court felt that the grant of certiorari opened the door for consideration of a broad due process question, it is entirely possible that some or all of the four members who voted against reversal did so solely on the voice identification issue squarely represented by the application for certiorari.
4 Secondly, as we understand the controlling decisions of the United States Supreme Court, we believe that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply in the usual sense in federal habeas corpus proceedings.

In Fay v. Noia the Supreme Court said: Frank v. Mangum supra [237 U.S.,] at 348 35 S.Ct. at 595 Hence, the familiar principle that res judicata is inapplicable in habeas proceedings e.g. Darr v. Burford 339 U.S. 200, 214 70 S.Ct. 587, 595 94 L.Ed. 761 Salinger v. Loisel 265 U.S. 224, 230 44 S.Ct. 519, 521 68 L.Ed. 989 Frank v.

McVeigh 93 U.S. 274, 282-283 23 L.Ed. 914 But conventional notions of finality in criminal litigation cannot be permitted to defeat the manifest federal policy that federal constitutional rights of personal liberty shall not be denied without the fullest opportunity for plenary federal judicial review Fay v. Noia supra 372 U.S. at 422-424 83 S.Ct. at 840-841 In Sanders , the Supreme Court discussed the same principle: At common law, the denial by a court or judge of an application for habeas corpus was not res judicata King v.

Noia supra 372 U.S. at 402 83 S.Ct. at page 829 The inapplicability of res judicata to habeas, then, is inherent in the very role and function of the writ Sanders v. United States supra 373 U.S. at 7-8 83 S.Ct. at 1072-1073 Thirdly, we do not believe that logically or historically a 4-4 division of the United States Supreme Court can be held to represent any federal adjudication of appellant's federal constitutional claims on the merits.
An equal division of an appellate court does not settle any principle of law or issue of fact for that court.
It represents affirmance of the judgment appealed from because there were insufficient votes for reversal.
Supreme Court opinions which we believe to be settled law demonstrates both principles: No attempt will be made to analyze them, or to decide on their application to the case before us, because the judges are divided respecting it.
Consequently, the principles of law which have been argued cannot be settled Etting v. Bank of United States 11 Wheat.
59 24 U.S. 59, 76 6 L.Ed. 419 If the judges are divided, the reversal cannot be had, for no order can be made.
The judgment of the court below, therefore, stands in full force, it is indeed, the settled practice in such case to enter a judgment of affirmance; but this is only the most convenient mode of expressing the fact that the cause is finally disposed of in conformity with the action of the court below, and that that court can proceed to enforce its judgment.
The legal effect would be the same if the appeal, or writ of error, were dismissed Durant v. Essex Co. 7 Wall. 107 74 U.S. 107, 112 19 L.Ed. 154 Consequently, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit remains in effect Anderson v. Johnson, Warden 390 U.S. 456 88 S.Ct. 1194 20 L.Ed.2d 27 As we read these decisions, the equally divided vote of the United States Supreme Court in Biggers v. Tennessee , 390 U.S. 404 , 88 S.Ct. 979 , 19 L.Ed.2d 1267 (1968), means only that "the judgment of [the Supreme Court of Tennessee] remains in effect."
Anderson v. Johnson , supra , 390 U.S. at 456 , 88 S.Ct. at 1194 .
There is, of course, no doubt that federal habeas corpus allows for subsequent federal review of claims of federal constitutional violations after final state court judgment.
And it is clear from the opinion of the Supreme Court of Tennessee, 411 S.W.2d 696 (1967), that it neither considered nor decided the federal constitutional validity of the "show-up" which the District Judge on habeas found invalid.
The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.
