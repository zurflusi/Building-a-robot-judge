 HARRY PHILLIPS , Circuit Judge.
This is an appeal from the order of the district court denying appellant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
Appellant, a Negro, was tried in the Circuit Court of Maury County, Tennessee, in 1949, under an indictment charging him with the crime of rape of a girl under fifteen years of age.
The jury returned a verdict of guilty and fixed his sentence at forty-nine years and one day.
Details as to appellant's previous criminal record and his personal history are set forth in the dissenting opinion of Judge McAllister.
In his trial in the State court appellant was represented by Mr. Pride Tomlinson, Jr., a leading member of the Maury County Bar, as court-appointed counsel.
This attorney filed a motion for a new trial, which later was dismissed on appellant's own application made in open court.
Appellant is now serving his sentence in the Tennessee Penitentiary.
The District Judge, the Honorable William E. Miller, conducted a thorough evidentiary hearing in the habeas corpus proceeding.
Appellant was represented capably in the district court by Mr. Kent Sandidge, III, of the Nashville Bar as court-appointed counsel.
Prior to the hearing in this court Mr. Sandidge had been appointed Assistant United States Attorney and was permitted to withdraw as counsel for appellant.
Thereupon, this court appointed Mr. James O. Bass, Jr., and Mr. J. Brad Reed of the Nashville Bar as counsel for appellant.
These attorneys have filed a comprehensive brief and made an able oral argument before this court.
Two questions are raised on this appeal: (1) that a confession was elicited from appellant subsequent to his arrest and before indictment, after his request to see a lawyer had been denied, relying upon Escobedo v. State of Illinois , 378 U.S. 478 , 84 S.Ct. 1758 , 12 L.Ed.2d 977 ; and (2) that Negroes were systematically excluded because of their race from the grand jury which indicted appellant and from the petit jury which convicted him, in violation of his rights under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment .
I. Appellant previously filed a habeas corpus proceeding in the State courts, but did not raise the Escobedo question in that proceeding.
This issue was presented for the first time in the district court in the present case. The district judge correctly ruled that appellant has failed to exhaust his State remedies and that the district court would not consider his claim for relief based on that issue.
28 U.S.C. 2254 .
It is now settled that neither Escobedo v. State of Illinois , supra , nor Miranda v. State of Arizona , 384 U.S. 436 , 86 S.Ct. 1602 , 16 L.Ed.2d 694 , would apply retroactively to this case, which was tried in 1949.
Johnson v. State of New Jersey , 384 U.S. 719 , 86 S.Ct. 1772 , 16 L.Ed.2d 882 .
Further, since appellant's contention is premised upon a denial of his right to counsel, and no question is made in this court as to the voluntariness of his confession, Davis v. State of North Carolina , 384 U.S. 737 , 86 S.Ct. 1761 , 16 L.Ed.2d 895 , is not applicable.
We accordingly hold that no relief on the issue of denial of the right to counsel is available to appellant in this case. II.
Both the grand jury which indicted appellant and the petit jury which returned a guilty verdict against him were composed entirely of members of the white race.
We now turn to the contention that Negroes were excluded systematically from the grand jury and the petit jury, in contravention of appellant's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment .
This contention is based upon a principle of constitutional law long since firmly established.

In Carter v. State of Texas , 177 U.S. 442, 447 , 20 S.Ct. 687, 690 , 44 L.Ed. 839 , the Supreme Court said: Fourteenth Amendment Strauder v. West Virginia 100 U.S. 303 25 L.Ed.2d 664 Neal v. [State of] Delaware 103 U.S. 370, 397 26 L.Ed. 567, 574 Gibson v. [State of] Mississippi 162 U.S. 565 16 S.Ct. 904 40 L.Ed. 1075 In Norris v. State of Alabama , 294 U.S. 587, 589 , 55 S.Ct. 579, 580 , 79 L.Ed. 1074 , the court said: The "rule of exclusion" has been applied to prohibit discrimination against any delineated class.
Hernandez v. State of Texas , 347 U.S. 475, 480 , 74 S.Ct. 667 , 98 L.Ed. 866 .
Briefly stated, the rule is: proof that Negroes constitute a substantial segment of the population of the jurisdiction, that some Negroes are qualified to serve as jurors, and that none of them have been called for jury service over an extended period of time establishes a prima facie case of systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service.

It is equally well settled that a member of a racial group has no constitutional right to be tried by a jury composed proportionately of members of his own race.

[State of] Texas 200 U.S. 316 26 S.Ct. 338 50 L.Ed. 497 14th Amendment District Judge Miller made a finding of fact that there was no purposeful exclusion of qualified Negroes from the grand and petit juries in Maury County, Tennessee, in 1949, including the following: Akins v. Texas 325 U.S. 398 65 S.Ct. 1276 89 L.Ed. 1692 "Whether there has been systematic racial discrimination by administrative officials in the selection of jurors is a question to be determined from the facts in each particular case."

"Our delicate and serious responsibility of compelling state conformity to the Constitution by overturning state criminal convictions, should not be exercised without clear evidence of violation."

The applicable Tennessee statutes relevant to the qualifications of jurors which were in effect in 1949 at the time of appellant's conviction were as follows: T.C.A.
Sec. 22-101 T.C.A., Sec. 22-102 T.C.A., Sec. 22-103 T.C.A., Sec. 22-104 T.C.A., Sec. 22-105 In 1949 there was in effect a private statute applicable to Maury County, which governed the method of selecting lists of prospective jurors.
The act, which created a county board of jury commissioners, provided that: The list selected from the tax books by the jury commissioners numbered approximately 1500.
The tax books of Maury County did not designate the race of the persons listed thereon.
Shortly before each term of court, all of the names on the jury commissioners list were placed in a box and a number of them (approximately 100) were drawn as prospective members of the jury panel for that term.
These persons whose names were drawn were summoned for jury duty for the next succeeding term and either served or were disqualified or excused by the judge.
In Maury County the relevant census figures were as follows: 1940 1950 Total Population 50,357 40,368 White 30,225 (66.5%) 31,782 (72.2%) Negro 10,130 (33.5%) 8,579 (27.8%) The figures as to males over 21 were as follows: White 8853 (66.9%) 9470 (73.7%) Negro 2918 (33.1%) 2486 (26.3%) The State trial judge who presided over the criminal trial of appellant was the Honorable Joe M. Ingram, who has served as judge of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Tennessee continuously since September 1, 1942.
The following affidavit of Judge Ingram was filed in the record in the district court in the present case: 28 U.S.C.A.
Section 2245 5112 4712 The case of Kennedy v. State , 186 Tenn. 310 , 210 S.W.2d 132 , cert. denied, 333 U.S. 846 , 68 S.Ct. 659 , 92 L.Ed. 1129 (1947), which is referred to in the affidavit of Judge Ingram, involved the question of whether there was a systematic exclusion of Negroes from juries in Maury County in 1946.
The opinion of the Supreme Court of Tennessee states that approximately eleven hundred pages of the record in that case were devoted to testimony on this question.
The Supreme Court of Tennessee said: 186 Tenn. at 317-318 210 S.W.2d at 135 The findings of the State court on the issue of discrimination, although not binding on the court, are entitled to great respect.
Pierre v. State of Louisiana , 306 U.S. 354, 358 , 59 S.Ct. 536 , 83 L.Ed. 757 .
Mr. Paul F. Bumpus, who served as district attorney general in Maury County from 1935 through 1950, testified that Negroes were summoned and appeared for jury duty "at practically every term of court as far as I can remember" but they generally were not willing to serve and asked to be excused; that "frequently they would have letters from their employers asking that they be excused, that they were needed badly at work."
Attorney-General Bumpus did not recall having seen a Negro serve on a jury in Maury County prior to 1949.
Mr. Pride Tomlinson, Jr., who represented appellant as court-appointed attorney at his trial in 1949, testified that Negroes were included in calls for jury duty in Maury County, particularly following certain racial troubles that occurred there in 1946, but that they frequently were excused from duty on their own applications.
Mr. Tomlinson did not recall having seen a Negro serving on a jury in the county prior to 1949, but testified that many Negroes have served and continue to serve on juries in the county since that time.
Appellant asserts that at the time of his trial and conviction in Maury County, Tennessee, there were three steps in the selection of jury panels: On the basis of the evidence introduced in the district court, appellant now concedes that there was no systematic exclusion in the first two steps.
Therefore if systematic exclusion of Negroes did in fact take place it would be the result of step three, i.e. either by disqualification or by the judge excusing from service persons summoned therefore.
In Swain v. State of Alabama , 380 U.S. 202, 226-227 , 85 S.Ct. 825, 839 , the Court said that: Likewise, the excusing of summoned Negro jurors from service upon their own application and for cause does not necessarily constitute systematic exclusion on account of race.
The fact that no Negro served on the grand jury that indicted appellant or on the petit jury that convicted him, coupled with the further fact that no witness testifying in the present case could recall having seen a Negro serving on a jury in Maury County prior to 1949, would have established a prima facie case of systematic exclusion, except for other evidence in the record.
Under the evidence hereinabove outlined, and especially in view of the detailed affidavit of Judge Ingram, we cannot say that the findings of fact of the district judge in the present case are "clearly erroneous."
Judge Ingram's affidavit was introduced into evidence under the authority of 28 U.S.C. 2245 , which provides that: To the extent that the affidavit of Judge Ingram contained statements as to matters which took place other than at the trial, we are of the opinion that it was properly admissible under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 2246 : The record in the present case discloses that, after the filing of the foregoing affidavit, the district judge allowed counsel for appellant fifteen additional days in which to propound written interrogatories or further questions to Judge Ingram, or to obtain a supplemental affidavit from him.
Although issues of fact in a habeas corpus case may not be established by ex parte affidavits alone, Walker v. Johnston , 312 U.S. 275, 287 , 61 S.Ct. 574 , 85 L.Ed. 830 ; Jones v. Cunningham , 313 F.2d 347, 349 (footnote 4, C.A. 4), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 832 , 84 S.Ct. 42 , 11 L.Ed.2d 63 , the procedure followed by the district court in the present case was in accord with the statute and would be calculated to help maintain a desirable relationship between State and Federal courts.
Both the Circuit Judge presiding over the State court in Maury County, Tennessee, and the United States District Judge for the Middle District of Tennessee are judges with original general jurisdiction.
It was fitting and proper that Judge Ingram not be called to testify as a witness in federal court so long as the rights of appellant were protected.
The rights of appellant were protected amply under the facts of the present case, in that his court-appointed attorney was accorded an opportunity to cross-examine Judge Ingram by interrogatories and to obtain a supplemental affidavit.
We hold that the findings of fact of the district court are not "clearly erroneous."
The judgment of the district court is affirmed.
This court takes this occasion to express its appreciation and thanks to Mr. James O. Bass, Jr.
and Mr. J. Brad Reed of the Nashville bar, who, acting under appointment of the court as counsel for appellant, undertook the laborious preparation of this case on review, and submitted excellent briefs and arguments on the difficult issues presented.
