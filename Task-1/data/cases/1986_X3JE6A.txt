 CORRECTED OPINION PER CURIAM: In this case we must determine whether a union violates 8(b)(4) (ii)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act when it distributes handbills urging a consumer boycott of all the tenants of a mall in furtherance of its dispute with a company constructing a building for one tenant of the mall.
I. The facts of the case are undisputed and are detailed in the opinion of the Supreme Court in DeBartolo Corp. v. NLRB , 463 U.S. 147 , 103 S.Ct. 2926 , 77 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983) ( "DeBartolo I" ).
Briefly summarized, the facts reflect the following.
DeBartolo owns a large shopping mall in Tampa, Florida.
Approximately 85 retail establishments are tenants of the mall.
One of the mall's tenants, H.J.
Wilson Company, Inc. ("Wilson's") contracted with High Construction Company ("High") to build a store for Wilson's at the mall.
Florida Gulf Coast Building Trades Council, AFL-CIO (the "Union"), became involved in a primary labor dispute with High over the payment of allegedly substandard wages and benefits.
The Union distributed handbills at the entrances to the mall urging that consumers not patronize tenants of the mall.
DeBartolo filed an unfair labor practice charge alleging that the Union was engaging in a secondary boycott in violation of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended ("NLRA" or the "Act"), 29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.
In February 1980, the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB" or the "Board") issued a complaint against the Union alleging a violation of 8(b)(4) (ii)(B) of the Act.
1 Without deciding whether the distribution of the handbills violated the statute, the Board concluded that the handbilling was not prohibited by the Act because of the "publicity proviso" 2 and dismissed the complaint.
Florida Gulf Coast Buildings Trade Council, AFL-CIO (Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.) , 252 N.L.R.B.
702 (1980).
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.
DeBartolo v. NLRB , 662 F.2d 264 (4th Cir.1981).
In DeBartolo I , the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Fourth Circuit and held that the Union's conduct fell outside the protection of the publicity proviso contained in 8(b)(4) .
463 U.S. at 157 , 103 S.Ct. at 2932 .
The Court did not determine whether the distribution of the handbills violated the underlying restrictions of the NLRA or, if so prohibited, whether the NLRA is constitutional under the First Amendment .
On remand, the NLRB issued the supplemental decision and order which are the subject of the instant case. The Board found that: Section 8(b)(4) Record on Appeal at 237.
The Board did not consider whether its interpretation of the Act would violate the First Amendment , presuming, "as a Congressionally created administrative agency[,] the constitutionality of the Act we administer."
Id. at 236 .
The Board issued an order instructing the Union to cease and desist from the distribution of handbills and requiring the Union to post an appropriate notice.
The Union petitions this court to set aside the decision and order of the NLRB.
The NLRB presents a cross-petition for enforcement of its order.
Because we find that the Union's handbilling activities do not violate 8(b)(4) (ii)(B) of the NLRA, we grant the Union's petition and deny enforcement of the order.
II.
The Supreme Court recognized that "this case arises out of an entirely peaceful and orderly distribution of a written message, rather than picketing."
3 DeBartolo I , 463 U.S. at 157 , 103 S.Ct. at 2933 .
The Union contends that such distribution of a written message is a form of speech protected by the First Amendment .
If 8(b)(4) (ii)(B) is interpreted to restrict the distribution of handbills, then, the Union argues, the NLRA violates the First Amendment .
Neither the courts nor the NLRB has directly considered the constitutionality of restricting nonpicketing union publicity.
Cf.
Hospital & Service Employees Union v. NLRB (Delta Air Lines) , 743 F.2d 1417, 1428 (9th Cir.1984).
If we were to conclude that the statutory provision in question makes it unlawful for unions to distribute such handbills to the public, we would be required to consider whether this provision is consistent with the First Amendment .
However, the statutory question presented is almost as novel as the constitutional question.
Neither the Supreme Court nor the court of appeals for any circuit has decided whether the statutory prohibition against threatening, coercing or restraining applies to the distribution of handbills.
The Supreme Court has held "that an Act of Congress not be construed to violate the Constitution if any other possible construction remains available."
NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago , 440 U.S. 490, 500 , 99 S.Ct. 1313, 1318 , 59 L.Ed.2d 533 (1979); accord DeBartolo I , 463 U.S. at 157 n. 10, 103 S.Ct. at 2933 n. 10 ("when Congress legislates in a fashion that restricts communicative activity, it expects the statutory language to be construed narrowly"); International Association of Machinists v. Street , 367 U.S. 740, 790 , 81 S.Ct. 1784, 1790 , 6 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1961) ("Federal statutes are to be construed as to avoid serious doubt of their constitutionality.").
"Moreover, the Court has followed this policy in the interpretation of the [NLRA] and related statutes."
Catholic Bishop , 440 U.S. at 500 , 99 S.Ct. at 1318 .
In Catholic Bishop , the Court stated that it would determine whether the statutory interpretation proposed by the NLRB "would give rise to serious constitutional questions."
Id. at 501 , 99 S.Ct. at 1319 .
If so, the Court held that "'the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed,'" id. at 501 , 99 S.Ct. at 1319 (quoting Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S.A. , 353 U.S. 138, 147 , 77 S.Ct. 699, 704 , 1 L.Ed.2d 709 (1957)), must be identified, before the statute could be construed in such a manner.
Thus, we must consider whether the statutory interpretation suggested by the Board would cause serious doubts about the constitutionality of 8(b)(4) .
If we determine that there would be serious constitutional questions, we must examine the statute and its legislative history to identify "the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed" to restrict such handbilling.
III.
In Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe , 402 U.S. 415 , 91 S.Ct. 1575 , 29 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971), the Supreme Court considered the validity of an injunction against distribution of leaflets which were alleged to be intended to coerce and intimidate an individual.
The individual was a real estate broker who was alleged to have engaged in tactics termed "panic peddling" and "block busting."
A community organization asked the broker to sign an agreement that he would not solicit real estate business in their community.
When the broker refused to sign the agreement, the organization distributed leaflets near his home which were critical of his business and which were designed to cause him to sign the agreement with them.
An injunction prohibiting the organization from distributing the leaflets was affirmed by a state appellate court on the ground that the alleged activities were coercive and intimidating, rather than informative, and were therefore not entitled to First Amendment protection.
Id. at 418 , 91 S.Ct. at 1577 .
The Supreme Court reversed, explaining: First Amendment First Amendment Id. at 419 , 91 S.Ct. at 1577-78 .
Thus, the distribution of handbills is generally fully protected by the First Amendment, even when designed to pressure others to act.
In NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co. , 458 U.S. 886 , 102 S.Ct. 3409 , 73 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1982), the Court, quoting at length from Organization for a Better Austin , held that the First Amendment protects a secondary boycott organized by a civil rights group.
The Court stated: "Speech does not lose its protected character, however, simply because it may embarrass others or coerce them into action."
458 U.S. at 910 , 102 S.Ct. at 3424 .
"'"Free trade in ideas" means free trade in the opportunity to persuade to action, not merely to describe facts.'"
Id. (quoting Thomas v. Collins , 323 U.S. 516, 537 , 65 S.Ct. 315, 325 , 89 L.Ed. 430 (1945)).
However, in Claiborne Hardware , the Court "recognized the strong governmental interest in certain forms of economic regulation, even though such regulation may have an incidental effect on rights of speech and association."
Id. at 912 , 102 S.Ct. at 3425 .
The Court gave the following as an example: Id. (quoting NLRB v. Retail Store Employees Union, Local 1001 (Safeco) , 447 U.S. 607, 617-18 , 100 S.Ct. 2372, 2378 , 65 L.Ed.2d 377 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part)).
The discussion of restrictions on secondary picketing in Claiborne Hardware reflects the settled principle that labor picketing is entitled to less First Amendment protection than pure speech.
Such treatment is based on the concept that picketing includes elements in addition to speech.
These additional elements justify restrictions on picketing which would not be permitted vis-a-vis pure speech: Bakery & Pastry Drivers & Helpers Local v. Wohl 315 U.S. 769, 775, 776 62 S.Ct. 816, 819 86 L.Ed. 1178 Fourteenth Amendment Hughes v. Superior Court , 339 U.S. 460, 464-65 , 70 S.Ct. 718, 720-21 , 94 L.Ed. 985 (1950).
See also Babbitt v. United Farm Workers National Union , 442 U.S. 289, 311 n. 17, 99 S.Ct. 2301, 2315 n. 17, 60 L.Ed.2d 895 (1979); 4 NLRB v. Fruit & Vegetable Packers & Warehousemen, Local 760 (Tree Fruits) , 377 U.S. 58, 77 , 84 S.Ct. 1063, 1073 , 12 L.Ed.2d 129 (1964) (Black, J., concurring); 5 International Board of Teamsters, Local 695 v. Vogt , 354 U.S. 284 , 77 S.Ct. 1166 , 1 L.Ed.2d 1347 (1957).
In Safeco , Justice Stevens reemphasized that picketing has a non-speech element the regulation of which may justify incidental restrictions of its speech element: Bakery Drivers v. Wohl 315 U.S. 769, 776-77 62 S.Ct. 816, 819-20 86 L.Ed. 1178 Safeco , 447 U.S. at 618-19 , 100 S.Ct. at 2379-80 (Stevens, J., concurring in part).
The handbilling in the instant case was peaceful and orderly.
It involved none of the non-speech elements, e.g. , patrolling, which justify restrictions on picketing.
6 In attempting to enlist the aid of consumers in its dispute with the construction company, the Union was relying "entirely on the persuasive force of the idea."
Id. at 619 , 100 S.Ct. at 2380 .
The handbills left the recipients completely free to act in agreement with the ideas presented or to refuse to do so. In the labor context, the Supreme Court has also held that communication which is merely a "threat of retaliation based on misrepresentation and coercion," NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co. , 395 U.S. 575, 618 , 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1942 , 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), is "without the protection of the First Amendment ."
Id. See also NLRB v. Virginia Electric & Power Co. , 314 U.S. 469, 477 , 62 S.Ct. 344, 348 , 86 L.Ed. 348 (1941).
In those cases, the Supreme Court held that communications which contained a "threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit" are not entitled to First Amendment protection.
In the instant case, the NLRB held that the Union, by urging consumers to avoid patronizing the mall tenants, hoped to coerce the mall tenants to pressure Wilson's and/or DeBartolo to force High, with whom the Union has a primary dispute, to use Union standards.
However, a finding of statutory coercion would not control the First Amendment analysis.
While the focus of 8(b)(4) (ii)(B) is coercion of the secondary employer, the secondary employer vis-a-vis the handbill is a non-listener.
The handbills in this case lacked any elements which could threaten, coerce or restrain the listeners, i.e., the consumers.
As pointed out in Gissel Packing and Virginia Electric & Power , for purposes of assessing the First Amendment protection to which communication is entitled, a court must focus on the possible coercion of the listeners, in this case, the consumers.
Moreover, as the Supreme Court stated in Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe and NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co. , the claim that speech is intended to exercise an ultimate coercive impact upon someone does not remove that speech from the reach of the First Amendment .
Claiborne Hardware , 458 U.S. at 911 , 102 S.Ct. at 3424 ; Organization for a Better Austin , 402 U.S. at 419 , 91 S.Ct. at 1577 .
In addition, it should be pointed out that the Union was not seeking to have the consumers, the mall tenants, or DeBartolo and/or Wilson's do anything which would be illegal.
The consumers were legally free to agree with the Union's position and decline to patronize the mall tenants.
The mall tenants would have been acting equally legally if, in response to the consumer pressure, they requested that DeBartolo and/or Wilson's request that High use union labor.
In the same way, Wilson's and/or DeBartolo would have been within the law if they requested High to acceed to the Union's demands regarding terms and conditions of employment.
In light of the absence of the non-speech elements which have permitted restrictions on labor picketing and in light of the full First Amendment protection afforded to handbilling and pamphleteering, we conclude that if 8(b)(4) (ii)(B) is construed to prohibit certain types of handbilling, serious constitutional questions will arise.
7 Therefore, we must examine the statute and its legislative history in order to identify "the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed" to prohibit such speech.
IV.
The language of the statute contains no clear expression of an affirmative intent of Congress to prohibit the distribution of handbills urging a secondary boycott.
It is true, however, that the prohibition against threatening, coercing, or restraining could be read very broadly.
Therefore, we must examine the legislative history of this portion of the NLRA to determine whether Congress intended to proscribe such publicity.
8 Congress originally made secondary boycotts an unfair labor practice in 1947 under the Taft-Hartley Act.
Section 8(b)(4) , as in effect from 1947 to 1959, prohibited unions from inducing a strike where the object of the strike was compelling an employer to cease doing business with any other person.
9 There were three major loopholes in the Taft-Hartley language: Tree Fruits , 377 U.S. at 64-65 , 84 S.Ct. at 1067-68 .
During both the Eighty-fifth Congress and the Eighty-sixth Congress, the Senate passed labor reform bills--the Kennedy-Ives bill during the Eighty-fifth Congress and the Kennedy-Ervin bill during the Eighty-sixth Congress--neither of which included any amendments to 8(b)(4) .
Id. at 65 , 84 S.Ct. at 1067 .
Several amendments proposed to fill the three major gaps in the Taft-Hartley Act were rejected by the Senate.
During the Eighty-sixth Congress, the Eisenhower Administration did introduce a bill to close the three loopholes.
In a message to Congress, "Transmitting a 20-point Program to Eliminate Abuses and Improper Practices in Labor-Management Relations," President Eisenhower proposed to S.Doc.

The Administration bill, S. 748, was the first Senate bill to propose making it an unfair labor practice to "threaten, coerce or restrain" a secondary employer.
In Tree Fruits , the Supreme Court noted that in testifying in support of the Administration's bill, the Secretary of Labor did not refer to consumer picketing as making the amendments necessary.
Tree Fruits , 377 U.S. at 65 , 84 S.Ct. at 1067 .
It is additionally clear that the Secretary did not refer to publicity directed at consumers as making amendments to 8(b)(4) necessary.

1567 -68 (1959), reprinted in 2 Leg.Hist.

Moreover, the Supreme Court found that Senator Goldwater, "an insistent proponent of stiff boycott curbs," who proposed his own amendments to close the loopholes, did not refer to consumer picketing, much less publicity directed at consumers, as making necessary the amendments which he and the Administration proposed.

at 979 and 1079.
10 When the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare reported out the Kennedy-Ervin Bill, S. 1555, without any proposal to amend 8(b)(4) , the proponents of such a change again listed the major loopholes which they felt needed to be closed in the prohibition against secondary boycotts.

Their report mentioned the problem with railroad and government employees, the inducement of individual employees, and hot-cargo clauses.
11 It also focused on "coercion of employers."
The report pointed out that there was a problem with a union threatening a secondary employer "with a strike or picket line if he continues to do business with [the primary] employer."
Id .
It stated that the Administration bill, S. 748, solved the "coercion of employers" problem by amending 8(b)(4) to make the restriction apply to "'threatern [sic], coerce, or restrain any person engaged in commerce ' as well as 'induce or encourage any individual employed by any person.'"
Id .
12 The Administration bill also dealt with the other three loopholes discussed.
Thus, it is evident that the proponents of the amendments to 8(b)(4) had in mind non-consumer picketing and more direct economic actions, e.g. , strikes, when they proposed to amend that section by making its restriction apply to "threaten, coerce, or restrain."
There is no indication that they intended to restrict distribution of publicity to consumers.
When the Kennedy-Ervin Bill was being debated by the full Senate, Senator McClellan, who had offered his own bills which included amendments to 8(b)(4) , proposed an amendment to make it unlawful to "exert, or attempt to exert any economic or other coercion against, or offer any inducement to, any [secondary] person engaged in commerce " 105 Cong.Rec.
5970 (1959), reprinted in 2 Leg.Hist.
at 1193.
Senator McClellan stated that the amendment would close the three loopholes discussed above and would also apply to secondary consumer picketing: That refers to establishing a picket line around a merchant's store 105 Cong.Rec.
5971 (1959), reprinted in 2 Leg.Hist.
at 1194 (emphasis added).
13 It is clear from this statement that Senator McClellan intended only to prohibit picketing of the secondary merchant.
Prior to his proposals regarding consumer picketing, the proponents of the Administration bill had not discussed any form of restriction on appeals to consumers.
See Tree Fruits , 377 U.S. at 65-67 , 84 S.Ct. at 1067-68 .
As was pointed out in Tree Fruits , the proposed House legislation "[f]rom the outset included provisions concerning secondary boycotts."
Id. at 67 , 84 S.Ct. at 1068 .
"The Landrum-Griffin bill, which was ultimately passed by the House, embodied the Eisenhower Administration's proposals as to secondary boycotts.
The initial statement of Congressman Griffin in introducing the bill which bears his name, contains no reference to consumer picketing in the list of abuses which he thought required the secondary boycotts amendments."
Id. at 67 , 84 S.Ct. at 1068-69 (footnotes omitted).
Thus, while the proponents of the House bill wanted, from the beginning of debate, to amend 8(b)(4) to close the major loopholes, there is no indication that consumer picketing or publicity was initially considered a problem.
On August 6, 1959, President Eisenhower delivered an address from his White House office on the need for effective labor reform.
In this speech, the President called for restrictions on secondary consumer picketing.
In discussing such picketing, President Eisenhower gave the following example: 105 Cong.Rec.
A8488 (1959), reprinted in 2 Leg.Hist.
at 1842.
Thus, President Eisenhower, in calling the attention of Congress and the nation to secondary action directed at consumers, framed the problem solely in terms of consumer picketing.
As the Supreme Court in Tree Fruits pointed out, later during House debates, Rep.
Griffin "did discuss consumer picketing , but only in the context of its abuse when directed against shutting off the patronage of a secondary employer."
Tree Fruits , 377 U.S. at 67 , 84 S.Ct. at 1069 (emphasis added).
In the following colloquy, which took place six days after the President's address, Rep.
Griffin discussed secondary action aimed at consumers: 105 Cong.Rec.
14 ,339 (1959), reprinted in 2 Leg.Hist.
at 1615.
It is clear from the above colloquy that Rep.
Griffin, who introduced the bill which was eventually passed by the House and whose bill contained the restricting amendments which eventually became law, clearly had in mind only prohibiting consumer picketing by his proposed amendments to 8(b)(4) .
14 Moreover, it is clear that he recognized that his bill was limited by the constitutional right of free speech.
The only suggestion in either house of Congress that the proposed amendments to 8(b)(4) would apply to nonpicketing labor publicity came from opponents of the amendments.
As the Supreme Court pointed out in Tree Fruits , "Senator Humphrey first sounded the warning early [in the Senate debates]."
Tree Fruits , 377 U.S. at 66 , 84 S.Ct. at 1068 .
In Tree Fruits , however, the Supreme Court stated that the interpretation which the opponents of a bill gave to that bill was not controlling.
The Court explained: Tree Fruits , 377 U.S. at 66 , 84 S.Ct. at 1068 (citations omitted).
The Court therefore refused to give any weight to the interpretations suggested by Senator Humphrey and Senator Morse, another opponent of the amendments to 8(b)(4) .
Id. A House-Senate conference committee, chaired by Senator Kennedy, considered the Landrum-Griffin bill and the Kennedy-Ervin bill and reached a conference agreement.
The suggestions of the committee regarding 8(b)(4) were enacted into law.
The conference committee agreed to recommend the amendments to 8(b)(4) contained in the Landrum-Griffin bill.
(The Kennedy-Ervin bill contained no amendments to 8(b)(4) .)
In response to the fears of the opponents of the amendments to 8(b)(4) , the conference committee drafted the publicity proviso to 8(b)(4) , which protects union appeals made through handbilling, advertising, and other nonpicketing publicity to consumers not to deal with a secondary employer who has a "producer-distributor" relationship with a primary employer.
DeBartolo I , 463 U.S. at 156 , 103 S.Ct. at 2932 .
The proviso "'was the outgrowth of a profound Senate concern that the unions' freedom to appeal to the public for support of their case be adequately safeguarded.'
NLRB v. Servette, Inc. , 377 U.S. 46, 55 , 84 S.Ct. 1098, 1104 , 12 L.Ed.2d 121 (1964)."
DeBartolo I , 463 U.S. at 157 n. 10, 103 S.Ct. at 2933 n. 10.
The publicity proviso was clearly drafted to cover nonpicketing labor publicity in the only example of secondary consumer activity which had been discussed- secondary union action taken against a retail store selling a struck manufacturer's product .
This paradigm had been placed before the nation and Congress by President Eisenhower in his August 6 radio address.
Senator McClellan and Rep.
Griffin also focused on this typical case. The legislators who feared that the amendments proposed to 8(b)(4) would cover nonpicketing labor publicity also discussed such publicity in terms of this paradigm case. 15 However, the fact that the publicity proviso was drafted in terms of the paradigm case, does not change the fact that at no time had a proponent of the amendments to 8(b)(4) stated that nonpicketing should be or was being prohibited by the amendments.
The Board argues that the publicity proviso is an exception to the prohibitions contained in 8(b)(4) .
The Board contends that if Congress had not intended to restrict nonpicketing publicity under 8(b)(4) (ii)(B), it would not have drafted the publicity proviso.
In a case of a true statutory exception what the Board argues would be true--an exception exists only to exempt something which would otherwise be covered.
However, the legislative history makes it clear that not only did the supporters of the amendments to 8(b)(4) intend only to prohibit consumer picketing , but also that the publicity proviso was inserted both to clarify their position that nonpicketing publicity was not prohibited and, most importantly, to allay the fears of the opponents of the amendments that such speech would be restricted.
In the House, Rep.
Griffin and, in the Senate, Senator Goldwater, introduced a report summarizing the "nature of the settlement reached by the conference on the important points of difference between the House and the Senate bill [sic]."

Regarding secondary boycotts, the summary analysis quoted above indicates that the House bill was designed to ban all hot cargo agreements, close the three loopholes in Taft-Hartley identified above, and prohibit secondary customer picketing at retail stores which sell a product produced by a manufacturer with whom the union has a primary dispute.
The Senate bill applied only to certain hot cargo agreements.
It contained no provisions regarding the three Taft-Hartley loopholes or secondary customer picketing.
The conference agreement indicates that the House provision as to hot cargo agreements was adopted with certain exceptions and that the three Taft-Hartley loopholes were closed as provided for in the House bill.
As to secondary customer picketing, the summary analysis states: 105 Cong.Rec.
17 ,181 (1959), reprinted in 2 Leg.Hist.
at 1454; 105 Cong.Rec.
16 ,539 (1959), reprinted in 2 Leg.Hist.
at 1712.
The summary analysis makes it clear that the prohibition on secondary actions directed at consumers restricts only "secondary customer picketing."
The summary analysis further points out that the publicity proviso is not an exception which exempts nonpicketing publicity which would otherwise be prohibited by the restrictions in the amendments to 8(b)(4) .
Instead, the summary analysis explains that the publicity proviso is a clarification of the fact that the prohibition was never intended to apply to nonpicketing publicity.
16 The summary analysis explains that a "clarification that picketing at primary site is not secondary boycott" was also added to 8(b)(4) .
Just as the proponents of the amendments to 8(b)(4) did not intend the language of their amendments to reach picketing at the primary site, they did not intend the language of their prohibitions to reach nonpicketing publicity.
17 In both cases the summary analysis uses the term "clarification" to describe the provisos.
Neither proviso was an exception; instead they were added to make clear that the prohibitory language does not reach primary picketing or nonpicketing publicity.
18 Moreover, the publicity proviso is not drafted in the terms of an exception.
Instead, it is drafted as an interpretive, explanatory section.
The publicity proviso begins as follows: " Provided further , That for the purposes of this paragraph (4) only, nothing contained in such paragraph shall be construed to prohibit publicity other than picketing " The fact that the publicity proviso says "nothing shall be construed to prohibit publicity" indicates that this proviso only explains how the prohibitions of the statute should be interpreted rather than creating an exception to the prohibitions contained in the statute.
(Emphasis added).
19 After the conference was complete, Senator Kennedy, a proponent of the publicity proviso, and Senator Goldwater, a proponent of the amendments to 8(b)(4) engaged in the following colloquy: 105 Cong.Rec.
16 ,413-14 (1959), reprinted in 2 Leg.Hist.
at 1431-32.
Just as the summary analysis introduced by Senator Goldwater and Rep.
Griffin indicated that the publicity proviso was a "clarification that other forms of publicity are not prohibited," Senator Kennedy's initial statement above indicates that be believed that the publicity proviso meant that "the union shall be free to conduct informational activity short of picketing."
20 The above colloquy also points out Senator Goldwater's concerns that the prohibitions of the statute not affect free speech.
21 In speaking in support of the conference bill, Senator Goldwater, a member of the conference committee and an ardent supporter of the amendments to 8(b)(4) , stated: 105 Cong.Rec.
16 ,419 (1959), reprinted in 2 Leg.Hist.
at 1437.
Thus, again a proponent of the amendments to 8(b)(4) indicated, while the final version of the bill was pending, that prohibition extended only to picketing.
Senator Goldwater made no mention of nonpicketing distribution of publicity in explaining why the amendments to 8(b)(4) were necessary.
Similarly, in speaking in support of the conference bill, Senator Curtis, a proponent of the amendments to 8(b)(4) , stated: 105 Cong.Rec.
16 ,423 (1959), reprinted in 2 Leg.Hist.
at 1441.
It is clear that the major purpose of the amendments remained the closing of the loopholes in Taft-Hartley and that nonpicketing publicity was not a target of the prohibitions.
In summary, we can ascertain no affirmative intention of Congress clearly expressed to prohibit nonpicketing labor publicity.
As pointed out in Tree Fruits , it was only in the later debates of the labor reform bill, after President Eisenhower had focused attention on consumer picketing of a retail distributor of a struck manufacturer, that both houses began to consider that the amendments should apply to consumer picketing.
Nowhere, except in the statements of the opposition, is there any suggestion that the amendments to 8(b)(4) would prohibit nonpicketing labor publicity.
V. In conclusion, we cannot find any indication that the entirely peaceful and orderly distribution of handbills, as in the instant case, was intended to be proscribed by Congress.
We therefore apply the rule of Catholic Bishop , 440 U.S. 490 , 99 S.Ct. 1313 , 59 L.Ed.2d 533 (1979), to the effect that before interpreting this statute in a manner that "would give rise to serious constitutional questions," id. at 501 , 99 S.Ct. at 1319 , we must first find "the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed."
Id.
Absent such a finding we must GRANT the Union's petition for review and DENY enforcement of the order of the Board.
