 WINTER , Circuit Judge: The sole issue in this case is whether the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey ("Port Authority") is immune from suit in federal courts by virtue of the Eleventh Amendment.
1 We conclude that the Eleventh Amendment immunity either does not extend to the defendant or has been waived.
The appellant, Patrick Feeney, is an employee of the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation ("PATH"), which operates rail facilities between New York and New Jersey and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Port Authority.
Feeney brought this action for damages for personal injuries allegedly suffered in the course of his employment.
He asserted these claims under the Federal Employers' Liability Act ("FELA"), 45 U.S.C. 51 et seq.
(1982), the Boiler Inspection Act, 45 U.S.C. 22 et seq.
(1982), and the Safety Appliance Act, 45 U.S.C. 1 et seq.
(1982).
PATH moved pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) for dismissal of the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that PATH enjoys immunity from suit in federal courts because of the Eleventh Amendment.
Judge Ward granted PATH's motion, 693 F.Supp.
34 , and Feeney appeals.
Feeney claims that the Port Authority is not a state agency for Eleventh Amendment purposes and, in the alternative, that, if it is such a state agency, its Eleventh Amendment immunity has been waived.
2 We agree with both arguments and reverse.
The claim that the Port Authority is not a state agency for Eleventh Amendment purposes requires that we examine it in some detail.
The Port Authority is "a body corporate and politic" created in 1921 by an interstate compact between New York and New Jersey.
The compact was approved by the United States Congress.

We conclude that the Port Authority, and therefore PATH, is not a state agency for Eleventh Amendment purposes.
In Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency , 440 U.S. 391 , 99 S.Ct. 1171 , 59 L.Ed.2d 401 (1979), the Supreme Court held that the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency ("TRPA"), a bi-state authority established by California and Nevada to regulate the development of the Lake Tahoe region, was not a state agency for purposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity.
The Court stated: Lake Country , 440 U.S. at 400-01 , 99 S.Ct. at 1176-77 (footnotes omitted).
In denying the TRPA the protection of the Eleventh Amendment, the Court cited the following factors: (i) the compact referred to the TRPA as a political subdivision of the states; (ii) six of the ten governing members of TRPA were appointed by counties and four by the states; (iii) TRPA's funding was provided by counties, not by the states; (iv) TRPA's function, the regulation of land, is traditionally a function of local, not state, government; (v) the states had no veto over the actions of the TRPA; and (vi) TRPA's obligations were not binding on the states.
Id. at 401-02 , 99 S.Ct. at 1177-78 .
Taking factors (i)-(v) into account, it appears that the case for denying Eleventh Amendment immunity to TRPA was stronger than is the case for denying it to PATH.
Favoring non-application of the Eleventh Amendment immunity to PATH is the fact that the compact between New York and New Jersey describes the Port Authority as a "municipal corporate instrumentality," N.Y.Unconsol.Laws 6459 (McKinney 1979) and N.J.Stat.Ann.
32:1-33 (West 1963), language consistent with its being a political subdivision.
Moreover, the Port Authority is to be self-sustaining financially, and its functions are localized and focus only on the port of New York.
Favoring application are the facts that all of the Port Authority Commissioners are appointed by the states, and the governors of the two states have a veto over the Commissioners' actions.
We do not believe, however, that the differences between the Port Authority and the TRPA constitute the requisite "good reason," Lake Country , 440 U.S. at 401 , 99 S.Ct. at 1177 , to conclude that the Port Authority was intended to be a state agency for Eleventh Amendment purposes.
In particular, we believe that factor (vi), whether liability will place the state treasury at risk, although not exclusively determinative, is the single most important factor.
See Trotman v. Palisades Interstate Park Comm'n , 557 F.2d 35, 38 (2d Cir.1977); see also Comment, Eleventh Amendment Immunity and State-owned Vessels , 57 Tul.L.Rev.
1523, 1528 (1983) (in determining whether to extend the Eleventh Amendment to a state agency "[t]he essential, but not exclusive, test is whether a monetary judgment against the agency would be satisfied out of the state treasury") (footnotes omitted).
In cases where doubt has existed as to the availability of Eleventh Amendment immunity, the Supreme Court has emphasized the exposure of the state treasury as a critical factor.
In Edelman v. Jordan , 415 U.S. 651 , 94 S.Ct. 1347 , 39 L.Ed.2d 662 , reh'g denied , 416 U.S. 1000 , 94 S.Ct. 2414 , 40 L.Ed.2d 777 (1974), for example, the Supreme Court stated that "[i]t is well established that even though a State is not named a party to the action, the suit may nonetheless be barred by the Eleventh Amendment [T]he rule [that] has evolved [is] that a suit by private parties seeking to impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the state treasury is barred by the Eleventh Amendment."
Id. 415 U.S. at 663 , 94 S.Ct. at 1355 (citations omitted); see also Lake Country , 440 U.S. at 400-01 , 99 S.Ct. at 1176-77 .
We believe it clear that a judgment against PATH would not be enforceable against either New York or New Jersey.
The Port Authority is explicitly barred from pledging the credit of either state or from borrowing money in any name but its own.
Even the provision for the appropriation of moneys for administrative expenses up to $100,000 per year requires prior approval by the governor of each state and an actual appropriation before obligations for such expenses may be incurred.
Moreover, the phrase "salaries, office and other administrative expenses" clearly limits this essentially optional obligation of the two states to a very narrow category of expenses and thus also evidences an intent to insulate the states' treasuries from the vast bulk of the Port Authority's operating and capital expenses, including personal injury judgments.
No provision commits the treasuries of the two states to satisfy judgments against the Port Authority, therefore.
We believe that this insulation of state treasuries from the liabilities of the Port Authority outweighs both the methods of appointment and gubernatorial veto so far as the Eleventh Amendment immunity is concerned.
We realize that our holding creates a conflict between ourselves and the Third Circuit regarding PATH, see Port Authority Police Benevolent Ass'n, Inc. v. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , 819 F.2d 413 (3d Cir.), cert. denied , U.S. , 108 S.Ct. 344 , 98 L.Ed.2d 370 (1987), that can be resolved only by the Supreme Court.
That decision, however, was based on the Third Circuit's understanding that in the event that "a judgment were entered against the Authority that was serious enough to deplete its resources, the Authority would be able to go to the state legislatures in order to recoup the amount needed for its operating expenses."
Port Authority Police Benevolent Ass'n , 819 F.2d at 416 .
To the extent that this statement implies that the states must make such an appropriation, it appears to be in error.
Under the compact, states are obligated to provide funds for Port Authority administrative expenses up to $100,000 only if their respective governors approve the request.
Judgments in the present action thus cannot lead to a depletion of state treasuries without gubernatorial consent.
Although we would normally be most reluctant to create a conflict with another circuit on a close issue, we believe that the issue is not close in light of legislation enacted by New York and New Jersey stating that the Port Authority may be sued in federal courts .
Even if the Port Authority enjoys Eleventh Amendment immunity, therefore, it has been waived.
We turn now to that issue.
In 1950 and 1951 New York and New Jersey respectively enacted legislation that "consent[ed] to suits, actions or proceedings of any form or nature at law, in equity or otherwise against the [Port Authority] " N.Y.Unconsol.Laws 7101 (McKinney 1979) and N.J.Stat.Ann.
32:1-157 (West 1963).
"Venue" for actions against the Port Authority consented to by this legislation, which include actions sounding in tort, expressly includes the federal courts.
N.Y.Unconsol.Laws 7106 (McKinney 1979) and N.J.Stat.Ann.
32:1-162 (West 1963).
The provision states in pertinent part: We acknowledge that the standard for determining whether a state has waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity is strict.
In Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon , 473 U.S. 234, 239-40 , 105 S.Ct. 3142, 3146 , 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985), reh'g denied , 473 U.S. 926 , 106 S.Ct. 18 , 87 L.Ed.2d 696 (1985), the Supreme Court stated that "a State will be deemed to have waived its immunity 'only where stated "by the most express language or by such over-whelming implication from the text as [will] leave no room for any other reasonable construction."'"
(citation omitted).
See also Edelman v. Jordan , 415 U.S. at 673 , 94 S.Ct. at 1361 .
PATH argues that the language of the legislation in question is not sufficiently explicit to satisfy the test set out in Atascadero State Hospital and Edelman .
Relying upon the Supreme Court's statement that "'[a] State's constitutional interest in immunity encompasses not merely whether it may be sued, but where it may be sued,'" Welch v. Texas Dep't of Highways and Public Transportation , 483 U.S. 468 , 107 S.Ct. 2941, 2946 , 97 L.Ed.2d 389 (1987) (citation omitted) (emphasis in original), PATH argues that the legislation governing the Port Authority's amenability to suit merely reflects the states' intention to waive the Port Authority's claim to sovereign immunity rather than its claim to Eleventh Amendment immunity.
PATH's argument, however, focuses solely upon the provisions allowing suits to be brought against the Port Authority, N.Y.Unconsol.Laws 7101 (McKinney 1979) and N.J.Stat.Ann.
32:1-157 (West 1963), and simply ignores the language of the legislation quoted above that expressly states that such suits may be brought in federal courts.
Moreover, what legislative history there is indicates that this result was consciously intended.
The 1950 New York State Legislative Annual thus refers to Howell v. The Port of New York Authority , 34 F.Supp.
797 (D.N.J.1940) as a decision that Section 7106 was designed to overturn.
1950 New York State Legislative Annual 203-04.
In Howell , the court granted a motion to dismiss based on sovereign immunity and the Eleventh Amendment.
Although the decisions cited in support of the dismissal appear to be exclusively sovereign immunity cases, Howell concluded that the Port Authority was a state agency rather than a political subdivision, a conclusion that would support immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.
34 F.Supp.
at 800-01 .
We concede that the statute's use of the term "venue" is somewhat anomalous in the Eleventh Amendment context.
We conclude, however, that the use of that term in no way undermines our conclusion that the provision evidences an intent to allow the Port Authority to be sued in the designated federal courts and is thus an explicit waiver, albeit partial, of the Eleventh Amendment.
If such an intent is not attributed to the provision, then the provision is entirely meaningless.
PATH's sole attempt to give meaning to the language in question is to argue that it relates to actions that may be brought in federal court where Congress has abrogated the Eleventh Amendment.
PATH has failed to provide specific examples of any such cases, however.
In any event, this argument is wholly unconvincing.
First, it is inconsistent with the Legislative Annual's reference to Howell .
Second, where Congress has abrogated the Eleventh Amendment immunity, states hardly need pass legislation waiving that abrogated immunity and have no power to determine the proper "venue" for actions brought pursuant to the abrogation.
We conclude, therefore, that the statutory provision establishing "venue" for suits against the Port Authority in United States courts is a waiver of the Eleventh Amendment.
