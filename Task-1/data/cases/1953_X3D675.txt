 DOBIE , Circuit Judge.
Plaintiffs instituted a civil action against defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, seeking an injunction and damages for the alleged infringement of six copyrights for small three-dimensional statuettes of male and female dancing figures made of semi-vitreous china.
Registration of these statuettes was duly granted to the plaintiffs by the Copyright Office.
The District Court dismissed the complaint of plaintiffs, who have appealed to us.
The decision of the District Court appears to be virtually a holding that a work of art which may be, and is, utilized for some practical purpose, may be protected only by a design patent and not by copyright.
No question of unfair competition is here involved, only the validity of the copyrights is in issue.
We think the District Court erred in holding the copyrights invalid.
The judgment below must, [**311] accordingly, be reversed.
The Register of Copyrights was permitted to file with us a brief as amicus curiae .
The works of plaintiffs here involved were executed by preparing original sketches, sculpturing the resulting figures in clay on a clay armature, and then preparing a mold from the clay sculpture for casting copies.
The specimens submitted to the Copyright Office were in statue form.
We think these statues may fairly be classified as "works of art."
Plaintiffs are in the business primarily, almost exclusively, of making and selling these statues in lamp form, though a few, very few, of the copyrighted statues have been sold as statues.
The copyrighted figures have been sold by defendants as parts of complete lamps, of which they form the base portion.
Beyond any dispute, defendants have meticulously and in minute detail copied every element of the copyrighted statues of the plaintiffs.
It is highly important, at the outset, to distinguish between a design patent and a copyright.
Although similar in some respects, the two disclose significant differences.
Of particular importance here are the requirements for their issuance and registration and the extent of the protection they afford.
A design patent may be obtained only for a "new, original and ornamental design for an article of manufacture".
35 U.S.C.A. 171 .
To be valid, therefore, a patent "must disclose a high degree of uniqueness, ingenuity and inventiveness".
Alfred Bell & Co. Ltd. v. Catalda Fine Arts, Inc. , 2 Cir., 191 F.2d 99, 100 .
A copyright, on the other hand, may be registered if the particular work is "original," i. e., if it owes its origin to the "author."
Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony , 111 U.S. 53, 57-58 , 4 S.Ct. 279 , 28 L.Ed. 349 .
It is "valid without regard to the novelty or want of novelty of its subject matter."
Baker v. Selden , 101 U.S. 99, 102 , 25 L.Ed. 841 .
Because the standards for obtaining copyright protection are of a lower order than those required for design patents, the protection granted under a copyright is more limited.
Since a copyright is intended to protect authorship, the essence of copyright protection is the protection of originality rather than novelty or invention.
Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co. , 188 U.S. 239, 249-250 , 23 S.Ct. 298 , 47 L.Ed. 460 ; Baker v. Selden , 101 U.S. 99, 102-104 , 25 L.Ed. 841 .
Said Circuit Judge Frank in Alfred Bell & Co. Ltd. v. Catalda Fine Arts, Inc. , 2 Cir., 191 F.2d 99, 103 : vis a vis More tersely put, "a copyright on a work of art does not protect a subject, but only the treatment of a subject."
F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary Arts , 1 Cir., 193 F.2d 162, 164 , affirmed 344 U.S. 228 , 73 S.Ct. 222 .
See, also, Copinger, "The Law of Copyrights" (7th Ed.1936); Admur, "Copyright Law and Practice" (1936); Ricker v. General Electric Co. , 2 Cir., 162 F.2d 141, 142 ; Arnstein v. Edward B. Marks Music Corporation , 2 Cir., 82 F.2d 275 ; Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corporation , 2 Cir., 81 F.2d 49, 54 ; Gerlach-Barklow Co. v. Morris & Bendien , 2 Cir., 23 F.2d 159, 161 .
The life of a copyright is much longer than that of a design patent.
For our purposes, the subject matter of a copyright includes, 17 U.S.C.A. 5(g) and (h): "works of art; models or designs for works of art; reproductions of a work of art."
The design patent primarily extends to "any new, original and ornamental design for an article of manufacture".
35 U.S.C.A. 171 .
Plaintiffs do not contend that defendants may not lawfully produce and sell an electric lamp whose base is a sculptured, human, dancing figure.
Nor do plaintiffs contend that defendants may not lawfully produce and sell an electric lamp whose base is an authorized copy of the sculptured, human, dancing figures copyrighted by plaintiffs.
Plaintiffs argue only that the production and sale of an electric lamp whose base is an unauthorized copy of the copyrighted statue of plaintiffs is an infringement of the copyright.
Thus, the issue is not whether a design of an electric lamp may be protected as a monopoly by means of a copyrighted registration.
Rather, the issue is whether a copyrighted statue may be copied irrespective of its use as a statue or as a component part of an electric lamp, or any other article of manufacture.

(Italics ours.)
Also we set out the applicable Copyright Regulations of 1926 and 1950: 1926 Regulation section 53 Works of art and models or designs for works of art so-called fine arts The protection of productions of the industrial arts utilitarian in purpose and character depends upon action under the patent law Toys, games, dolls or similar articles are examples.
The exclusive right to make and sell such articles, should not be sought by copyright registration Present Regulation 1950 Regulation (as amended to July 1, 1952) section 207 202.8 [**313] not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned Certainly very germane here is the testimony of Mr. Arthur Fisher, Register of Copyrights, who speaks from experience and with authority.
He is in charge of the Copyright Office and supervises the registration of claims to copyright and the making of rules and regulations by that office.
He testified that at the time he came to the Copyright Office in 1946 the practice was well established of registering "any work which in our opinion is a work of art, even though such work has a mechanical or utilitarian aspect."
Mr. Fisher further testified that this practice is now covered by Regulation 202.8.
From his testimony, we quote: " it is the practice of the Copyright Office to make a determination as to whether the work submitted is or is not a work of art.
The phrase 'insofar as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned' is interpreted by the office and by our examiners to permit them to deal only with the question of whether the work is a work of artistic craftsmanship, and they consider, it is our practice to consider as immaterial whether the work may also have a mechanical or utilitarian aspect.
"We do not consider that we are registering or dealing with that mechanical or utilitarian aspect but are only dealing with the artistic aspect of the work which is submitted under an application for a work of art.
"I might give some example of that.
For example, if this Daumier etching, engraving that I have on the walls were framed and were submitted to us with some indication that it was to be used as a modern tea tray with a stand, our office would deal only with the artistic aspect of the work and would not be concerned with the fact that it also had a utilitarian use or purpose.
"Again, we frequently will receive applications for the registration of paintings on plates, for example.
We register the painting on the plate but we are not concerned with the fact that the material upon which the painting is made may be intended as an article of utility for the handling of food.
In other words the practice of the office with respect to this phrase about which I am asked is not to undertake to register or deal with the mechanical or utilitarian aspects, but exclusively to determine whether the work that is submitted to us is a work of art and we disregard the question of whether it has in addition a mechanical or utilitarian function."
Space limitations prevent any extended discussion of the historical development through the years of the Copyright and Design Patent Statutes.
It is worthy of note, in connection with our case, however, that in 1902 Congress narrowed the Design Patent Statute to exclude statuary.
Even more important was the change in the Copyright Statute when the term "works of the fine arts" found in the 1870 Statute was changed and broadened by the substitution in the Statute of 1909 of the words "works of art".
Certainly there are many works of art not included in the fine arts.
Mr. Herbert Putnam, Librarian of Congress, testifying before a Committee of the House of Representatives, 1906, stated: Concededly, a copyright does not purport to give to the copyrightee any rights to the mechanical or utilitarian uses of a work of art.
A copyright does, however, protect the work of art qua work of art without regard to any functional use to which it might be put.
A subsequent utilization of a work of art in an article of manufacture in no way affects the right of the copyright owner to be protected against infringement of the work of art itself.
The critical inquiry, therefore, is not whether the particular work sought to be registered has utility but whether it is a work of art irrespective of its utility.
Since 1909, it seems to have been the practice of the Copyright Office to grant copyrights to works of art, and to deny copyrights to purely utilitarian objects.
An object of artistic conception in a standard art form--e. g., sculpture or painting--has not been denied registration merely because of its possible utilitarian aspects.
It is the work of art that is thus protected, not its utilitarian aspects.
Thus copyright registration has been granted for stained glass windows, bas-relief bronze doors, sculptures in book-ends, candlestick holders and statuary lamps.
On the other hand, it has been the practice of the Copyright Office since 1909 to refuse copyright registration only to those works of a wholly utilitarian nature, which could not be called works of art although they might possess pleasing design.
Rejection has been placed on the ground that protection for such works lay only under the Design Patent Law.
Thus, registration has been refused for designs for refrigerators, clocks, stoves, gasoline pumps and oil dispensers.
[**314] When an agency of the United States is empowered by a federal statute to issue regulations under, and also to administer and apply, that statute, and when the agency over a course of years applies that statute in a certain way, that application should be given great weight when a court is called upon to determine the meaning of the statute.
Cf. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. South Texas Lumber Co. , 333 U.S. 496, 501 , 68 S.Ct. 695 , 92 L.Ed. 831 ; Merchants National Bank of Boston v. Commissioner , 320 U.S. 256, 260 , 64 S.Ct. 108 , 88 L.Ed. 35 ; Textile Mills Securities Corp. v. Commissioner , 314 U.S. 326, 338, 339 , 62 S.Ct. 272 , 86 L.Ed. 249 .
Said Mr. Justice Holmes in Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co. , 188 U.S. 239 , at page 251, 23 S.Ct. at page 300 (in 1903 before the 1909 Copyright Law): See, also, Pellegrini v. Allegrini , D. C., 2 F.2d 610 ; Jones Bros. Co. v. Underkoffler , D. C., 16 F.Supp.
729 .
Would not Mr. Justice Holmes, in the instant case, say that a statue is just as much a work of art when used to support a lamp as when it is displayed in an art gallery?
Consider Rodin's celebrated statue, "The Thinker."
No one can deny that it is a "work of art" by any definition of the term.
Yet it is a matter of common knowledge that this work can--and has, been used in book ends.
Under the decision below, the book end form cannot be covered by a copyright of the statue form.
We hardly think Congress intended this extreme and harsh result.
The same observations might be made of many of the works of the great Benvenuto Cellini which had, potentially at least, utilitarian aspects.
We now proceed to a discussion of certain of the decided cases which seem to be most closely in point.
Defendants rely heavily on Stein v. Expert Lamp Co. , D. C., 96 F.Supp.
97 , affirmed 7 Cir., 188 F.2d 611 , certiorari denied 342 U.S. 829 , 72 S.Ct. 53 , 96 L.Ed. 627 .
The opinions of District Judge LaBuy in the District Court in this case and Circuit Judge Kerner in the Court of Appeals each cover less than two printed pages.
In Judge LaBuy's opinion he states, 96 F.Supp.
at page 97 : Again, 96 F.Supp.
at page 98 : And Judge Kerner remarked, 188 F.2d at page 612 : In the case before us, the statuettes were submitted to the Copyright Office in statuette form, not in the form of lamp bases.
And some, though not many, of the copyrighted statuettes have been sold by plaintiffs as, and in the form of, statuettes.
If this case be not distinguishable, we decline to follow it.
Stein v. Benaderet , D. C., 109 F.Supp.
364 , followed the Expert case. District Judge Picard, however, made this pertinent observation, 109 F.Supp.
at page 365 : Stein v. Expert Lamp Co. supra In Stein v. Rosenthal , D. C., 103 F.Supp.
227 , District Judge Tolin refused to follow the Expert case.
He pointed out 103 F.Supp.
at page 229 : [**315] And again, 103 F.Supp.
at page 230 , he stated: Also, 103 F.Supp.
at page 231 , Judge Tolin remarked: We greatly prefer the reasoning here to that in the Expert case.
It is quite clear that the District Judge in our case relied heavily on the Expert case and found "unconvincing the District Court's reasoning" in the Rosenthal case. For Law Review notes taking exception to the Expert case, see 27 Indiana L.J. 130; 21 George Washington L.Rev.
353; 66 Harvard L.Rev.
877 .
We append a brief extract from each of these notes: 27 Indiana L.J. 131 66 Harv.L.Rev.
882 See, also, Derenberg, "Copyright Law," 1948 Annual Survey of American Law, 777; Weil, "Copyright Law," 625; Umbreit, "A Consideration of Copyright Law," 87 Univ. of Pa.L.Rev.

King Features Syndicate v. Fleischer , 2 Cir., 299 F. 533, 534 , involved an issue somewhat similar to that of the instant case.
There the "Barney Google and Spark Plug" cartoons were copyrighted.
These copyrights were based on sketches deposited in the Copyright Office.
The defendants copied the sketches in a three-dimensional doll form.
The Circuit Court of Appeals squarely rejected the argument that execution of the art in a different form avoided infringement.
King Features Syndicate v. Fleischer was followed a decade later by Fleischer Studios v. Ralph A. Freundlich, Inc. , 2 Cir., 73 F.2d 276 .
Here the Court held that a doll in the form of "Betty Boop" infringed the Betty Boop cartoons which were copyrighted as works of art.
In Fleischer Studios v. Ralph A. Freundlich, Inc., the copyright proprietor, through a licensee, distributed thousands of toys and dolls like those accused as infringements.
This did not alter the relief granted since the doll copies in each instance embodied the artistic conception of "Betty Boop."
In Hill v. Whalen & Martell , D.C., 220 F. 359 , a dramatic performance using actors dressed like "Mutt" and "Jeff" was held to infringe the copyrighted "'Mutt' and 'Jeff'" cartoons.
These cases differed from the instant case in that there the copyrightee did not use the copyrighted material in a form different from the form under which the material was copyrighted.
In our case, the material was copyrighted as statuettes, but was afterwards embodied by the copyrightee in a lamp base.
Nor did the plaintiffs here create any fictional characters and associate them by name, such as "Barney Google" or "Betty Boop," which became well known to the public.
We are not impressed by the contention of counsel for defendants that the plaintiffs have here misused their copyrights and should on that ground be denied relief.
Cf. Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co. , 314 U.S. 488, 788 , 62 S.Ct. 402 , 86 L.Ed. 363 ; E. I. Horsman & Aetna Doll Co. v. Kaufman , 2 Cir., 286 F. 372 , certiorari denied 261 U.S. 615 , 43 S.Ct. 361 , 67 L.Ed. 828 .
The equities here, we think, [**316] lie with the plaintiffs, not with the defendants, who deliberately and meticulously copied the copyrighted statuettes by incorporating them into lamp bases.
It is strenuously contended by plaintiffs, and by the Government in its brief as amicus curiae , that the Copyright Statute and the Design Patent Statute are overlapping--in other words, that there is a field in which an applicant, at his option, could secure either a copyright or a design patent.
This is vigorously denied by defendants.
We do not think it necessary, in order to decide the case before us, to pass upon this important question.
All that we hold, and all that we need hold, is that the copyrights of the statuettes granted to plaintiffs were valid, even though plaintiffs intended primarily to use these statuettes in the form of lamp bases and did so use them, and that these copyrights were clearly infringed by defendants, who minutely copied these statuettes in the form of bases for lamps.
Plaintiffs are, accordingly, entitled to the appropriate forms of relief usually granted in such cases.
The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed and remanded.
