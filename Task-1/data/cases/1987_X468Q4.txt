 FAIRCHILD , Senior Circuit Judge.
This action involved, among other things, regulation of correspondence between inmates of different prisons, and rejection of publications directed to inmates.
Named plaintiffs were prisoners and former prisoners suing on behalf of themselves and all other prisoners in federal institutions.
On June 7, 1974, the district court ordered that the action be maintained as a class action, except for determining the question of damages, and that the class consist of all current and future prisoners.
On September 1, 1978, on plaintiff's motion, the district judge ordered the addition, as plaintiffs, of the Prisoners' Union, Weekly Guardian Associates, and the Revolutionary Socialist League, publishers of publications which had been rejected at federal prisons.
On September 13, 1984, after trial, the district court filed a decision, and ordered defendants permanently enjoined from applying certain regulations, but granted judgment for defendants in all other respects.
Plaintiffs and defendants appealed from the portions of the judgment adverse to them.
Defendants' appeal, however, was later dismissed on their motion.
Individual damage claims had been "severed" before trial.
Assuming that the existence of unresolved damage claims deprives the judgment of finality, we have jurisdiction [**188] under 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1) since the order refused injunctions sought by plaintiffs.
In arguing the appeal, plaintiffs have not challenged all the portions of the judgment adverse to them.
The issues argued relate to a general prohibition, with certain exceptions, of inmate-to-inmate correspondence, and censorship of publications directed to inmates.
I. Prohibition on Inmate-to-Inmate Correspondence The regulation relating to correspondence between inmates, 28 C.F.R. 540.17 (1986), reads as follows: Although the language is permissive in form, the record indicates that the regulation amounts to a prohibition except for correspondence between family members or those involved in a legal action.
The district court upheld the regulation, writing as follows: The Supreme Court recently upheld a very similar prohibition in Turner v. Safley , U.S. , 107 S.Ct. 2254 , 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987).
Turner clearly controls this point, with one possible exception.
The regulation considered in Turner permits correspondence "concerning legal matters," but the regulation before us is more restrictive, permitting an inmate to correspond with another inmate who "is a party or a witness in a legal action in which both inmates are involved."
Plaintiffs challenge the regulation on the ground that it prevents inmates from seeking [**189] and obtaining legal assistance from other inmates.
This argument rests upon the inmates' "constitutional right of access to the courts."
Bounds v. Smith , 430 U.S. 817, 821 , 97 S.Ct. 1491, 1494 , 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977).
In Johnson v. Avery , 393 U.S. 483, 490 , 89 S.Ct. 747, 751 , 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969), the Supreme Court held that "unless and until the State provides some reasonable alternative to assist inmates in the preparation of petitions for post-conviction relief, it may not validly enforce a regulation barring inmates from furnishing such assistance to other prisoners."
See Rudolph v. Locke , 594 F.2d 1076, 1078 (5th Cir.1979).
Johnson was extended to assistance in civil rights actions in Wolff v. McDonnell , 418 U.S. 539, 577-80 , 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2985-86 , 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974).
430 U.S. at 828 , 97 S.Ct. at 1498 .
As suggested by the Johnson language, there is no absolute right to the assistance of another inmate if a reasonable alternative is provided.
It has been held that where an adequate method of access is provided, an inmate may not insist on the right to the assistance of a particular inmate.
Gometz v. Henman , 807 F.2d 113, 116 (7th Cir.1986); Storseth v. Spellman , 654 F.2d 1349, 1353 (9th Cir.1981).
The Bureau has several regulations pertaining to "Inmate Legal Activities" 28 C.F.R. 543.10 -.16.
Defendants point out a provision requiring each Warden to establish an inmate law library and procedures for access to legal reference materials and to legal counsel, and for the preparation of legal documents.
Section 543.15 governs legal aid programs which are funded or approved by the Bureau.
Section 543.11(f) provides that unless the institution has an active, ongoing legal aid program, the Warden shall allow an inmate the assistance of another inmate during leisure time.
If, in fact, the Bureau failed to provide resources and assistance sufficient to fulfill an inmate's right to meaningful access to the courts without the assistance of inmates in other institutions by correspondence, an amendment to the prohibition of correspondence would be required.
The record, however, does not establish the lack of a reasonable alternative.
II.
Rejection of Publications The Bureau of Prisons has issued regulations delegating to each warden authority to reject a publication to which an inmate has subscribed or which has been otherwise sent to him.
Generally the warden may reject a publication only if it is determined "detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution or if it might facilitate criminal activity."
28 C.F.R. 540.71(b) (1986).
The regulation also sets forth a non-exhaustive list of criteria, and a publication which meets one of them "may" be rejected.
Rejection by the warden is subject to appeal within the Bureau of Prisons.
We set forth in an Appendix the governing regulations, 28 C.F.R. 540.70 and 540.71(b) , (c), (d), and (e), as well as a portion of a Bureau Program Statement No. 5266.5 which contains updated additional instructions dealing with sexually explicit material.
Plaintiffs challenge on First Amendment grounds parts of 540.71(b) and the Program Statement facially and as applied.
They seek a specific determination on 46 rejected publications.
"[A] prison inmate retains those First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system."
Pell v. Procunier , 417 U.S. 817, 822 , 94 S.Ct. 2800, 2804 , 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974).
The freedom of the inmates to receive publications and to read them is at stake.
"It is now well established that the Constitution protects the right to receive information and ideas.
'This freedom [of speech and press] necessarily protects the right to receive '" Stanley v. Georgia , 394 U.S. 557, 564 , 89 S.Ct. 1243, 1247 , 22 L.Ed.2d 542 (1969) (quoting Martin v. City of Struthers , 319 U.S. 141, 143 , 63 S.Ct. 862, 863 , 87 L.Ed. 1313 (1943)).
More significantly, however, in this area of the law, the regulation causes a restriction on the First Amendment rights of the publishers of the material, including those publishers who are plaintiffs.
See Procunier v. Martinez , 416 U.S. 396, 409 , 94 S.Ct. 1800, 1809 , 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974), and Turner , U.S. at , 107 S.Ct. at 2259 [**190] .
The Supreme Court has not articulated a standard of review to be applied to censorship of content in the exact context presented here.
Martinez , 416 U.S. at 413 , 94 S.Ct. at 1811 comes close.
Martinez dealt with ideas expressed in correspondence (where here the expressions come to the inmate in published material).
Martinez dealt with inter-personal communication between inmates and non-inmates, and emphasized protection of the rights of the non-inmate correspondent in two-way communication (where here the communication is in one direction, and not between individuals; the right of the non-inmate being to publish and the right of the inmate being to receive and read).
Both Martinez and the case at bar deal with some aspect of the First Amendment rights of a non-inmate, and both deal with the expression of ideas on paper and not with conduct qua expression.
We conclude that the Martinez standards are applicable here.
1 Stating criteria for justifying censorship of prisoner mail, the Martinez Court said, 416 U.S. at 413 , 94 S.Ct. at 1811 .
Critical to both the Martinez holding and our case is the question of the required degree of probability that an expression of an idea will cause conduct destructive of security or order.
(Little in our case involves a claimed impairment of rehabilitation.)
Turning to that matter, the Martinez Court went on: 416 U.S. at 414 , 94 S.Ct. at 1811 .
We think it follows that a regulation authorizing censorship must reflect, and in applying the regulation the prison administrator must carry, the burden of showing that the censorship is "generally necessary."
2 [**191] The district court, however, concluded that the Martinez standards are not applicable to censorship of publications, and placed the burden of proof on plaintiffs.
Citing Pell v. Procunier , 417 U.S. 817 , 94 S.Ct. 2800 , 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974), Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Union , 433 U.S. 119 , 97 S.Ct. 2532 , 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977), and Bell v. Wolfish , 441 U.S. 520 , 99 S.Ct. 1861 , 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the court said, The government argues in support of the district court's conclusions.
We think these cases dealt with action and conduct occurring or threatened within the prisons and we do not agree that they state the standard for permissible censorship of information and ideas expressed in publications.
The regulation upheld in Pell v. Procunier forbade press and other media interviews with specific individual inmates.
The Court said, in part, 417 U.S. at 827 , 94 S.Ct. at 2806 .
In distinguishing Martinez , the Court stated as follows: Procunier v. Martinez supra 417 U.S. at 826 , 94 S.Ct. at 2806 (citation omitted).
In Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Union , the Court upheld actions of prison officials prohibiting inmates from soliciting other inmates to join the Prisoners' Union, barring all meetings of the Union, and refusing to deliver packets of Union publications mailed in bulk to several inmates for redistribution among others.
433 U.S. at 121 , 97 S.Ct. at 2535 .
The prison officials held the view that a prisoners' union would be detrimental to order and security.
"It is enough to say they have not been conclusively shown to be wrong in this view."
433 U.S. at 132 , 97 S.Ct. at 2541 .
[**192] Cf. Procunier v. Martinez 416 U.S. at 412-16 94 S.Ct. at 1810-13 433 U.S. at 133 , 97 S.Ct. at 2541 .
Again, as in Pell v. Procunier , conduct within the prison, rather than the content of expression, was the critical issue.
433 U.S. at 131-32 , 97 S.Ct. at 2540-41 (citation omitted).
Bell v. Wolfish 441 U.S. at 550-51 , 99 S.Ct. at 1880 (citations omitted).
As the Court pointed out, this rule operated without regard to the content of the expression.
Id. at 551 , 99 S.Ct. at 1880 .
In Turner v. Safley , U.S. , 107 S.Ct. 2254 , 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987), the Court upheld a prison regulation prohibiting correspondence between inmates of different institutions unless they are family members, and struck down a regulation greatly restricting marriage of an inmate.
The lower courts had applied Martinez to the prohibition on inmate-to-inmate correspondence.
The Supreme Court found that reliance improper, saying of Martinez , not Id .
416 U.S. at 409 94 S.Ct. at 1809 Ibid. Id. at , 107 S.Ct. at 2260 .
After summarizing the decisions which came after Martinez , the Court said: Pell Jones Bell Martinez Id. at , 107 S.Ct. at 2261 .
The Court concluded that the prohibition of correspondence between inmates fulfilled the standard, but the rule on marriage did not.
We find no holding that the tests for prison censorship of a publication on the basis of content, having an impact on the rights of the publisher, are different from those stated in Martinez .
If a regulation were to authorize the Warden to reject a portion of a publication only if he found that the material would "encourage" violence, or some other specified [**193] type of conduct breaching security or order or in some particular way impairing rehabilitation, we think that regulation could survive the minimum Martinez tests.
Language in Martinez suggests that encouragement would be a sufficient causal nexus between expression and proscripted conduct so that the expression could be rejected.
3 A Warden's finding to that effect would be entitled, on review, to deference by reason of his expertise.
Martinez , 416 U.S. at 405, 414 , 94 S.Ct. at 1807, 1811 ; Pell , 417 U.S. at 827 , 94 S.Ct. at 2806 ; Jones , 433 U.S. at 126 , 97 S.Ct. at 2538 ; Bell , 441 U.S. at 551 , 99 S.Ct. at 1880 ; and Turner , U.S. at , 107 S.Ct. at 2260 .
Going beyond minimum constitutional requirements, it would follow that the more pointedly the regulation spelled out a requirement of a specific finding, including reasons therefor, that particular rejected material would very probably produce a specifically described breach of security or order or an impairment of rehabilitation in some particular way, the more likely each rejection would be sustained when challenged in court.
The regulation before us, however, fails to satisfy the minimum Martinez test.
Although the introductory paragraph of (b) appears at first to limit the Warden's authority to rejecting material "determined detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution," it goes on to provide: "or if it might facilitate criminal activity."
"[M]ight facilitate" permits a far looser causal nexus between expression and proscribed conduct than "encourages."
Moreover, the term "detrimental" is susceptible of different meanings and must be interpreted in the light of the fact that the Regulation goes on expressly to authorize rejection of a publication which meets any one of a list of seven criteria, the list being non-exhaustive.
Plaintiffs do not challenge criterion (1) ("depicts or describes procedures for the construction or use of weapons, ammunition, bombs, or incendiary devices"); a portion of (2) ("contains blueprints, drawings or similar description of Bureau of Prisons institutions"); (3) ("depicts or describes procedures for the brewing of alcoholic beverages, or the manufacture of drugs"); or (4) ("written in code") The balance of criterion (2) authorizes rejection of a publication which "depicts, encourages, or describes methods of escape from correctional facilities."
Although "encourages" would suffice as a causal nexus between expression and proscribed conduct, "depicts" and "describes" do not.
Criterion (5) is deficient in several respects.
It authorizes rejection of a publication which "depicts, describes or encourages activities which may lead to the use of physical violence or group disruption."
Again, "depicts" and "describes" fall short.
"Activities" are described as those which "may lead" to physical violence or group disruption.
"Group disruption" could mean types of events which are not a breach of security or order or an impairment of rehabilitation.
Criterion (6) authorizes rejection of a publication which "encourages or instructs in the commission of criminal activity."
As to that which "instructs" there is no requirement of a finding of a probability that the publication will produce a breach of security or order or an impairment of rehabilitation.
Criterion (7) relating to sexually explicit material should doubtless be read as interpreted or qualified by Bureau Program Statement No. 5266.5.
( See Appendix.)
Paragraph (a) of the Statement enumerates specific types of sexually explicit material, but it requires no finding of causal nexus between possession of the listed material and breaches of security or order or impairment of rehabilitation.
The Bureau follows the practice of rejecting and returning an entire publication once a portion of it is deemed objectionable.
Even assuming that the portion is appropriately rejected under Martinez standards, rejection of the balance is not [**194] "generally necessary" to protect the legitimate governmental interest involved in the portion properly rejected.
Defendant Carlson admitted that there is really no reason for not deleting the offending material and turning over the balance to the inmate, although there was testimony by some that in their judgment deleting specific portions would generate more discontent than total rejection.
The district court found that these fears were reasonably founded.
We conclude the finding conflicts with the holding of Martinez that prison administrators have the burden of showing that a restrictive practice is "generally necessary."
416 U.S. at 414 , 94 S.Ct. at 1812 .
Thus, this practice of rejecting an entire publication where a part is objectionable is inconsistent with the First Amendment.
At the time of rejection of a publication, the Warden writes to the inmate, informing him of the rejection and the reasons for it.
28 U.S.C. 540 .71(d) (1986).
The district court did not address particular reasons for rejection, but generally concluded "that the notices normally make the general nature of the warden's objections clear," and that the We have not examined every statement of reasons for rejection, but there are some, at least, which cannot be deemed findings of an adequate causal nexus between a rejected publication and a breach of security or order or interference with rehabilitation.
Examples are: (1) The publication is the March 21, 1977, issue of The Call .
The relevant small portion of the issue is an article entitled "Hell holes at Marion Prison--Prisoners expose 'Control Unit'."
The story is highly critical of described practices, but is narrative in form.
While asserting that "inmates have staged strikes and facts and have continued to struggle against their oppression," it contains no exhortation.
The Atlanta warden's comment asserts that the issue The Call
