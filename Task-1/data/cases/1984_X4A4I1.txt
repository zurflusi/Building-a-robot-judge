 SCHROEDER , Circuit Judge.
Plaintiff-appellant, Valerie Saks, suffered a permanent hearing loss in her left ear while she was a passenger on an international flight operated by the defendant airline, Air France.
The alleged cause was normal cabin pressurization changes during landing.
Saks sued Air France for damages under Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention, Oct. 12, 1929, 49 Stat. 3000 (1934), 137 L.N.T.S.
(1929), art.
17.
The district court granted summary judgment for the airline on the ground that an injury caused by an air carrier's normal operation is not an "accident" within the meaning of Article 17.
Relying on two cases out of the Third Circuit, the district court ruled Saks could not recover damages unless she could show some malfunction or abnormality in the aircraft's operation.
See DeMarines v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines , 580 F.2d 1193 (3d Cir.1978); Warshaw v. Trans World Airlines, Inc. , 442 F.Supp.
400 (E.D.Pa.1977).
We reverse because we hold that a showing of a malfunction or abnormality in the aircraft's operation is not a prerequisite for liability under the Warsaw Convention.
Imposition of such a requirement is not supported by either the language and history of the Warsaw Convention, the contractual modification to the Warsaw system known as the Montreal Agreement, or the decisions of many courts, including this one, which now interpret the Convention as imposing absolute liability for injuries proximately caused by the risks inherent in air travel.
Our analysis begins with the language of the treaty itself.
Day v. Trans World Airlines, Inc. , 528 F.2d 31 (2d Cir.1975), cert. denied , 429 U.S. 890 , 97 S.Ct. 246 , 50 L.Ed.2d 172 (1976).
Article 17 provides: A finding that an "accident" has occurred is essential to invoking the provisions of Article 17.
MacDonald v. Air Canada , 439 F.2d 1402, 1404 (1st Cir.1971).
Yet nothing in the language of Article 17 or elsewhere in the Convention defines an "accident."
Nor is there language in Article 17 or elsewhere in the Convention which makes improper or abnormal operation of the aircraft a prerequisite to recovery.
In normal usage an "accident" is viewed from the perspective of the person experiencing the injury.
One who is injured in a fall down the steps of an aircraft has surely had an "accident" even though the aircraft and the steps themselves functioned normally.
See Chutter v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines , 132 F.Supp.
611, 613 (S.D.N.Y.1955) (fall from open door of aircraft is an "accident").
A standard dictionary definition of "accident" is an "event occurring by chance or arising from unknown causes."
Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary (6th ed. 1979).
When we look to a definition within the aviation context, we find the term "aircraft accident" expressly defined in annex 13 to the Convention on International Aviation, signed by the United States, France and others in 1944 and codified at 49 C.F.R. 830.2.
That definition is: an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight and all such persons have disembarked The situation here fits squarely within that definition; the effect of the aircraft's depressurization upon plaintiff's ear is clearly an "occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft."
More than definitions should be considered, however.
We should interpret a treaty to give effect to its apparent purposes, taking into account both its legislative history and the conduct of the signatories subsequent to ratification.
Reed v. Wiser , 555 F.2d 1079 (2d Cir.), cert. denied , 434 U.S. 922 , 98 S.Ct. 399 , 54 L.Ed.2d 279 (1977); Husserl v. Swiss Air Transport Co., Ltd. , 351 F.Supp.
702 (S.D.N.Y.1972), aff'd per curiam , 485 F.2d 1240 (2d Cir.1973); Block v. Compagnie Nationale Air France , 386 F.2d 323 (5th Cir.1967), cert. denied , 392 U.S. 905 , 88 S.Ct. 2053 , 20 L.Ed.2d 1363 (1968).
The district court's ruling in this case permits a carrier to avoid liability under the Warsaw Convention by showing that the plaintiff's injury, although caused by the aircraft, was not an "accident" because it resulted from normal carrier operations.
Such a defense is, in essence, a restatement of the defense of due care.
Yet that defense is no longer available in an action under the Warsaw Convention.
The district court's decision in this case, like the decisions in DeMarines and Warshaw upon which it relied, is therefore contrary to the Warsaw Convention as it presently operates.
This can be demonstrated clearly by tracing the history of that treaty from its inception to the present.
The Warsaw Convention 1 was concluded on October 12, 1929, during the infancy of international air travel.
The Convention's original purposes were two-fold: to establish uniform rules for the treatment of air travel and to limit potential carrier liability for air accidents so as not to frighten away potential investors.
The Convention established a fault-based system for carrier liability with the burden placed upon the carrier to show lack of negligence.
The carrier could rebut the presumption by proving that all necessary measures to avoid the damage were taken or that it was impossible to take such measures.
See Article 20(1).
2 In exchange for the presumption of negligence, the Convention limited carrier liability to $8,300 per passenger.
See Articles 17, 22.
Secretary of State Cordell Hull focused on the liability limitation when he transmitted the Convention to the United States Senate, stating: Senate Comm. on Foreign Relations, Message from the President of the United States Transmitting a Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules , Sen.Exec.Doc.
No.
G, 73rd Cong., 2d Sess.
3-4 (1934).
From the beginning, however, the United States experienced difficulty with the $8,300 limitation.
3 In November, 1965, the United States denounced the Warsaw Convention and announced its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw system.
50 Dep't State Bull.
923 (1965).
The United States offered to withdraw its denunciation before it took effect if an international agreement could be reached to raise the limits on liability.
Id. at 924.
Consequently, the Warsaw signatories convened in Montreal in 1966 to attempt to hold the Convention together.
See Lowenfeld and Mendelsohn, 80 Harv.L.Rev.
at 563.
In Montreal, the United States supported retention of the Warsaw Convention's negligence system, coupled with raising carrier liability to $100,000 per passenger.
When this was rejected by the other signatories, withdrawal by the United States appeared imminent.
To prevent that result, a group of international carriers, including Air France, reached a private interim agreement with the approval of the State Department, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and the International Air Transport Association.
Montreal Agreement, CAB Order No. E-23680, 31 Fed.Reg.
7302 (1966).
4 The Montreal Agreement represented a true compromise; in exchange for raising the liability limit to $75,000 per passenger, the United States agreed to the elimination of the airlines' due care defense contained in Article 20(1).
While the Montreal Agreement is not an official amendment to the Warsaw Convention, it is contractually binding on both the United States and Air France, and must be followed in our courts.
31 Fed.Reg.
7302 (1966).
Both courts and commentators have construed the Montreal Agreement as the adoption of absolute liability by the signatories.
See Evangelinos v. Trans World Airlines, Inc. , 550 F.2d 152 (3d Cir.1977) (en banc); Day v. Trans World Airlines, Inc. , 528 F.2d 31 (2d Cir.1975), cert. denied , 429 U.S. 890 , 97 S.Ct. 246 , 50 L.Ed.2d 172 (1976); Husserl v. Swiss Air Transport Co., Ltd. , 351 F.Supp.

The shift from negligence to absolute liability was in accord with the changed circumstances of the airline industry.
By the 1960's, air travel was relatively safe and airlines were able to obtain insurance at reasonable rates.
Absolute liability made sense on several levels.
First, it guaranteed to passengers the prospect of quick, less-expensive settlements.
Lowenfeld and Mendelsohn, 80 Harv.L.Rev.
at 600.
Second, it was in harmony with theories of accident cost allocation, since airlines could distribute among all passengers what would otherwise be a crushing loss to victims and their families.
Day v. Trans World Airlines, Inc. , 528 F.2d at 34 .
Finally, absolute liability could be justified on the theory that while the passenger was in the airline's control, the airline could best prevent injuries from occurring.
Husserl v. Swiss Air Transport Co., Ltd. , 351 F.Supp.
at 707 .
Since the Montreal Agreement, United States courts have extended Article 17 to a number of contexts never contemplated by the Warsaw Convention's original drafters.
For example, airlines are now held liable for intentional acts such as hijacking or terrorist activities.
As the Husserl court stated: Husserl v. Swiss Air Transport Co. , 351 F.Supp.
at 706 .
Similarly in Day v. Trans World Airlines, Inc. , 528 F.2d 31 (2d Cir.1975), and Evangelinos v. Trans World Airlines, Inc. , 550 F.2d 152 (3d Cir.1977), two cases arising from a terrorist attack on passengers waiting to board a TWA flight in Athens, Greece, the Second and the Third Circuits ruled that the word "accident" was to be construed broadly so as to effectuate better protection of the passenger.
See also Karfunkel v. Air France , 427 F.Supp.
971, 975-76 (S.D.N.Y.1977); Krystal v. British Overseas Airways Corp. , 403 F.Supp.
1322 (C.D.Cal.1975).
This circuit has approved the Second and Third Circuits' analyses in Day and Evangelinos .
Maugnie v. Compagnie Nationale Air France , 549 F.2d 1256 (9th Cir.) (Wallace, J., concurring), cert. denied , 431 U.S. 974 , 97 S.Ct. 2939 , 53 L.Ed.2d 1072 (1977).
In Maugnie we said that the "[Warsaw] Convention functions to protect passengers from the hazards of air travel and also spreads the acts and cost of air transportation among all passengers."
Id. at 1259 .
Although the Maugnie court ruled that under the facts the plaintiff was too far removed from the airplane to qualify as having been in the process of embarking or disembarking for purposes of Article 17, the majority adopted a broad, cost allocation theory of liability under the Convention.
Id. at 1260-62 .
These policy considerations also justify imposing liability when, as in this case, the normal operation of the aircraft has caused an injury.
In keeping with the concept of absolute liability embodied in the Warsaw Convention as contractually modified by the Montreal Agreement, the critical issue for courts to determine is causation rather than negligence.
Thus, in Chutter v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Inc. , 132 F.Supp.
611 (S.D.N.Y.1955), a pre-Montreal Agreement case, the plaintiff had been assigned a seat near the front of the airplane, returned to the rear, and stepped out the open door while the loading ramp was being removed.
The court was satisfied that "the accident causing the damage occurred within the terms of Article 17," id. at 613 , but ruled against the plaintiff on contributory negligence and statute of limitations grounds.
See also MacDonald v. Air Canada , 439 F.2d 1402 (1st Cir.1971) (plaintiff denied recovery in part because her collapse in the baggage area could not be attributed to anything associated with the flight); Morris v. Boeing Co. , 15 Av.Cas.
(CCH) ¶ 17,241 (S.D.N.Y.
June 29, 1978) (Article 17 requires a showing of proximate cause); Scherer v. Pan American World Airways, Inc. , 14 Av.Cas.
(CCH) ¶ 17,410 (N.Y.App.Div.
Oct. 14, 1976) (requirements of Article 17 not satisfied where plaintiff alleged only that he suffered thrombophlebitis while sitting aboard an airplane).
Indeed, the only recent cases that look beyond causation to how the carrier was operating at the time the injury occurred are the two cases out of the Third Circuit upon which the district court relied in this case. DeMarines v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines , 580 F.2d 1193 (3d Cir.1978); Warshaw v. Trans World Airlines, Inc. , 442 F.Supp.
400 (E.D.Pa.1977).
In applying a restrictive, negligence-based definition of "accident" to injuries involving the effect of depressurization on passenger hearing, those decisions are out of step with the Montreal Agreement and every other recent decision imposing absolute liability on airlines for injuries caused by air travel.
Since in this case we must assume for purposes of review that the aircraft's depressurization caused the plaintiff's loss of hearing, and since depressurization is the product of aircraft operation, summary judgment was improperly granted for the airline.
The case must be remanded for trial.
Reversed and remanded.
