 JERTBERG , Circuit Judge: Before us is an appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1291 by the plaintiff below and appellant in this court, Securities and Exchange Commission, from a final judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Arizona granting judgment on the pleadings for the defendants below, appellees here.
The action was brought pursuant to Section 21(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78u(e) , to enjoin violations of the antifraud provisions of that Act.
Sec. 10(b), 15 U.S.C. 78j(b) , and Rule 10b-5 of that Act, 17 CFR 240.10b-5 , and for other relief.
Appellant sought to undo the merger of two stock life insurance companies on the ground that the proxy solicitation material mailed to the stockholders of the two firms contained positive misrepresentation of material facts, and also failed to state material facts necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made.
Appellee National Securities, Inc. is a Colorado corporation doing business in Arizona as a holding company owning a controlling interest in the stock of National Life & Casualty Insurance Company, an Arizona corporation.
Appellees Wallace, Bohannan, Saffert, Wilkins, Barrett, Setter and Large are officers of the appellees National Securities, National Life, or another subsidiary of National Securities.
Appellee Producers Life Insurance Company is an Arizona corporation which conducts a life insurance business in Arizona and other western states.
As of April 27, 1964, Producers Life had approximately 14,000 stockholders with 880,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, including 50,203 treasury shares.
Of that total, 66,320 shares were owned directly by a group consisting of Richard G. Johnson, Ernest A. Richards, William A. Reedy, Bonnie B. Bilbrey, and Producers Thrift & Loan Company, an Arizona corporation, whose stock was owned by Johnson, Richards, Reedy, Bilbrey and one other person, the first four being referred to in this litigation 1 as the "selling directors."
The selling directors, together with J. Grant Iverson, Jess E. Hunter, and John J. Falconer, made up Producers Life's board of directors.
In addition, the selling directors other than Bilbrey held voting proxies for about 565,000 shares.
The amended and supplemental complaint in substance alleges that since March 15, 1964, appellees and the selling directors have made use of means and instrumentalities in interstate commerce and the mails to advance a scheme by manipulative and deceptive devices in connection with the purchase and sale of stock in Producers Life and National Life to defraud Producers Life and its stockholders by making false and misleading statements, and that since that date appellees have effected various arrangements with the ultimate purpose of merging Producers Life with National Life in derogation of the rights of Producers Life's stockholders, and contrary to the fiduciary responsibilities of the selling directors and appellees Wallace, Saffert, Wilkins, Barrett, and Large.
The complaint sets forth in detail the various acts, transactions and occurrences which transpired, leading up to the consolidation agreement of November 27, 1964, between National Life and Producers Life.
The agreement provided for the submission of the agreement to the stockholders of Producers Life and National Life.
Beginning in August, 1964, appellees National Securities, National Life, Bohannan, Wallace, Saffert, Wilkins, Barrett, Setter and Large conducted a proxy solicitation campaign by mailing communications to Producers Life's 14,000 stockholders throughout the United States.
It is the alleged material misstatements and the alleged omission of material facts in these proxy solicitation communications of which appellant complains.
The complaint then alleges, in detail, numerous misstatements and omissions of material facts.
A special stockholders' meeting was held on April 19, or 26, 1965, at which the shareholders approved and confirmed the merger.
The complaint further alleges that following the stockholders meeting, the appellees sent false and misleading statements to the shareholders of Producers Life.
It is further alleged that the consolidation agreement is void as an essential element of a fraudulent scheme and because it had never been validly approved by the requisite two-thirds majority of the stockholders.
It appears that the merger agreement was submitted to the Arizona Director of Insurance on May 7, 1965, and approved by him on July 9, 1965.
It further appears that since that time the National Group has conducted the affairs of National Life and Producers Life as a single operation.
In the court below, appellant prayed for the following relief: 10(b) Rule 10b-5 10(b) Rule 10b-5 On September 1, 1965, appellees filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings or, in the alternative, for summary judgment.
The district court granting the motion for summary judgment on the pleadings, 2 stated inter alia: 10 (b) 10(b) Rule 10b-5 59 Stat. 33 15 U.S.C. 1011-1015 10(b) Rule 10b-5 15 U.S.C. 1012(b) A.R.S.

20-731 A.R.S.
20-161--20-166 21(e) 15 U.S.C. 78u(e) 10(b) Rule 10b-5 A.R.S.
20-731 15 U.S.C. 1012(b) Appellant specifies that the district court erred: Section 10(b) Rule 10b-5 Section 10(b) Rule 10b-5 Appellees contend on this appeal that the suit must be dismissed for want of indispensable parties.
The indispensable parties referred to are Johnson, Richards, Reedy and Bilbrey referred to earlier in this opinion as the "selling directors", and Producers Thrift & Loan Company, who are not now parties to the action.
(See fn.
1.)
It is clear that the district court did not reach the question whether the consolidation of Producers Life and National Life into National Producers involved purchases or sales of securities in connection with which the alleged fraud occurred.
In view of the conclusion which we have reached, we shall discuss only one of the issues of law raised by appellant.
That issue is whether the allegations of the amended and supplemental complaint, which allegations must be presumed by us to be true, warrant the invalidation of the merger in light of the provisions of the McCarran Act.
The preamble to the McCarran Act sets forth its purpose: 15 U.S.C. 1011 The Act further provides: 15 U.S.C. 1012(b) The Act then makes certain federal statutes (Sherman Act, Clayton Act, and Federal Trade Commission Act) applicable to the business of insurance "to the extent that such business is not regulated by State law", and other federal statutes (National Labor Relations Act, Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, and Merchant Marine Act, 1920) fully applicable to the business of insurance.
15 U.S.C. 1012 (b), 1014.
The McCarran Act was passed following the decision in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association , 322 U.S. 533 , 64 S.Ct. 1162 , 88 L.Ed. 1440 (1944).
In that case the Supreme Court held that interstate transactions in the business of insurance were interstate commerce and therefore subject to regulation by Congress under the commerce clause.
This decision upset the previously long-held understanding that the business of insurance was not commerce and was subject only to state regulation.
On this understanding was built a substantial structure of regulation by the states.
"[T]he states took over exclusively the function of regulating the insurance business in its specific legislative manifestations.
Congress legislated only in terms applicable to commerce generally, without particularized reference to insurance."
Prudential Insurance Co. v. Benjamin , 328 U.S. 408, 415 , 66 S.Ct. 1142, 1147 , 90 L.Ed. 1342 (1946).
Immediately after the South-Eastern Underwriters decision, Congress took action on previously-introduced bills to exempt the insurance business from federal anti-trust regulation.
But the ultimate result was a bill which enunciated a considerably broader policy.
The focus shifted from a narrow exemption from the Sherman and Clayton Acts to a general policy of exemption with specific exceptions to that policy.
As was stated by the co-author of the bill, Senator Ferguson: 91 Cong.Rec.
481 The following colloquy between Senator Ferguson and another major draftsman of the bill, Senator O'Mahoney, makes the same point: 91 Cong.Rec.
1487 It is clear that the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, appellant's statutory mainstay in this case, is grounded on Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce.
See 15 U.S.C. 78b .
Cf.
Preamble to Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 74 .
There is no reference to the Securities Exchange Act in the debates on the McCarran Act.
We are left then with a general intention to set the insurance business outside the scope of all existing and future legislation regulating interstate commerce, without any more direct evidence that Congress had in mind the Securities Exchange Act.
3 However, Congress was apparently seeking to define an exemption for insurance coterminous with its power to regulate interstate commerce.
This is evident from sections 3 and 4 of the McCarran Act, 15 U.S.C. 1013 , 1014 .
There, Congress enumerated specific statutes, grounded on its interstate commerce power, and the extent to which they should apply.
It is significant that Congress felt that such diverse acts as the National Labor Relations Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act would otherwise have fallen within the exemption.
91 Cong.Rec.
483 An equally vital purpose of the McCarran Act was to preserve intact from any federal intrusion based on the commerce clause, existing and future State regulation of the insurance industry.
The commerce clause was not to be used as a springboard for federal regulation in the absence of specific statutory reference to insurance.
By enacting the McCarran Act, Congress "clearly put the full weight of its power behind existing and future state legislation to sustain it from any attack under the commerce clause to whatever extent this may be done with the force of that power behind it, subject only to the exceptions expressly provided for."
Prudential Insurance Co. v. Benjamin , supra , at 328 U.S. 431 , 66 S.Ct. at 1155 .
The major proponent of the bill, Senator McCarran, himself made this same point.
"In enacting this law, Congress held out an invitation to the States to deal affirmatively and effectively with those activities and practices of the insurance business which might otherwise be subject of federal regulation."
McCarran, Federal Control of Insurance, 34 A.B.A.J.
539, 540 (1948).
See also Donovan, Regulation of Insurance under the McCarran Act, 15 Law & Contemp.
Prob. 473, 490 (1950).
The State of Arizona accepted the invitation of the McCarran Act.
59 Stat. 33 20-441 .
The prohibited practices are then set out in subsequent sections.
See Ariz.Rev.Stat.
20-442--20-456 .
The section of the Arizona Insurance Code relating to mergers states: 20-731 4 The State of Arizona has affirmatively asserted its power to regulate the merger of insurance companies.
It has not merely deemed such mergers to be legal, nor perfunctorily incorporated by reference its corporate merger provisions, but has set out additional standards and empowered a state agent to enforce them.
The fact that these standards are not identical to those in the federal securities laws is not sufficient to allow the engrafting of federal standards into the merger.
supra 5 Some light is shed on this problem by the enactment of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1964, 78 Stat. 565 (1964), effective in 1966, insofar as their legislative history displays Congress' current understanding of the scope of the McCarran Act.
6 As stated by the district court in its order granting judgment of dismissal: 14 15 U.S.C. 78 (n) 17 CFR 240.14a-9 14 78 Stat. 569 12 (g) (2) 15 U.S.C. 78(l) 7 The Committee Report indicates the continued solicitude of the Congress for state regulation of the insurance business, including practices related to insurance stocks.
We are in accord with the views expressed by the district court that: A.R.S.
20-731 c 15 U.S.C. 1012 (b) The judgment appealed from is affirmed.
