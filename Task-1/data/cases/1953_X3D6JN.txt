 BONE , Circuit Judge.
This is a petition by the National Labor Relations Board for enforcement of the Board's order directing, among other things, that respondent bargain collectively with International Association of Machinists, District No. 27 (hereinafter called "Union").
The order was issued after the usual proceedings under 10 of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C.A. 141 et seq., in which the Board found that respondent had refused to bargain collectively with the Union, in violation of 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (5) of the Act.
1 Respondent resists enforcement upon three grounds: (1) that the Board does not have jurisdiction over the unfair labor practices charged; (2) that the Board's finding that respondent refused to bargain is not supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole; and (3) that the Board's finding that at the time of the alleged refusal to bargain the Union represented a majority of the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit is not supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.
Respondent, an individual, sells Chrysler and Plymouth automobiles at Van Nuys, California, as a dealer under franchise from the Chrysler Corporation, which operates in California and other states.
During the calendar year 1950 respondent purchased automobiles of a value in excess of $400,000 from the Chrysler Corporation.
All of these automobiles were assembled, purchased, and sold within the State of California.
Approximately 50 per cent of the parts going into the automobiles were shipped into California from outside the state.
On the question whether respondent is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act, our very recent case of National Labor Relations Board v. Howell Chevrolet Company , 9 Cir., 204 F.2d 79 , in which on facts almost identical to those involved in the case at bar we upheld the jurisdiction of the Board, is controlling.
See also National Labor Relations Board v. Townsend , 9 Cir., 185 F.2d 378 , certiorari denied 341 U.S. 909 , 71 S.Ct. 621 , 95 L.Ed. 1346 ; National Labor Relations Board v. Ken Rose Motors , 1 Cir., 193 F.2d 769 .
The facts as to the alleged refusal of respondent to bargain with the Union are as follows.
On April 12, 1951, the Board conducted a consent election among respondent's employees to determine whether the employees desired the Union to represent them in collective bargaining.
Of the 15 employees in the concededly appropriate bargaining unit, eight voted for the Union.
No objection to the election was filed and on April 20, 1951, the Regional Director certified the Union as the employees' bargaining representative.
On April 19, 1951, one week after the election and the day before the certification was issued, respondent, the Union and the Board each received by mail a sheet reading: "April 18, 1951 "We the undersigned majority of the employees of Ray Brooks, Chrysler-Plymouth Dealer, 6530 Van Nuys Blvd., Van Nuys, Calif., are not in favor of being represented by Union Local No. 727 as a bargaining agent.
We respectfully submit this petition for your consideration."
The purported signatures of nine of the 15 employees in the bargaining unit were appended beneath.
On April 27 a Union representative asked respondent for a conference to negotiate a collective bargaining contract.
Respondent, by his counsel, replied by letter on May 1.
In the letter respondent declared that he had been "given to understand" that the majority of the employees had repudiated the Union and no longer wished to be represented by it.
Respondent then called attention to a recent decision of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, apparently N.L.R.B.
v. Vulcan Forging Co. , 6 Cir., 188 F.2d 927 , holding that an employer could not be compelled to bargain with a union under such circumstances.
Respondent concluded his letter: There is no evidence of any further communication between respondent and the Union.
Respondent contends that its letter of May 1 did not constitute a refusal to bargain, but only a request for the "Union's opinion as to the advisability of a meeting in view of the repudiation of the Union by the employees."
The letter, written by respondent's counsel, refers to a favorable court decision, indicates its effect, and suggests, albeit in question form, that it would be "wiser" to put off any negotiation until it appeared that the Union had secured a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit.
While clothed in polite and conciliatory language, the purport of the letter was that, unless and until the Union could prove its majority, the employer was under no legal obligation to bargain and was not inclined to do so.
We cannot say that the Board was unjustified in construing this letter as a refusal to bargain.
2 We think we must regard the purported communication of the employees repudiating the Union as authentic.
At the same time that the employees' communication was sent to respondent, copies were also sent to the Union and to the Board.
There is no evidence that the Union ever challenged its genuineness, although it would have been a simple task to check whether the nine purported signatories had in fact signed the document and it was clearly to the interest of the Union to make the fact known if they had not.
It was proved that the names signed were names of employees in the bargaining unit.
While respondent did not call the purported signers to verify their signatures, counsel supporting the complaint neither moved to strike the document for such failure nor made any attempt to impeach it.
Under these circumstances we think it would be unreasonable to stamp the communication a possible forgery, and accordingly we take it as a fact that a majority of respondent's employees repudiated the Union on April 18, 1951.
The final question presented is whether respondent was obliged to bargain with the Union in light of the repudiation of the Union by a majority of respondent's employees within a week after the Union had been designated as bargaining representative in a Board-conducted election.
This problem has given the courts some difficulty and the decisions are not harmonious.
This court has not previously had occasion to pass upon the question.
3 The Wagner Act, as the National Labor Relations Act was known prior to its amendment in 1947, contained provisions for Board-conducted elections but did not specify the intervals at which such elections should be held or the effect of a certification once issued.
The Board saw fit to adopt a rule that when a bargaining representative had been elected by a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit and certified by the Board, its representative status could not be disturbed for a reasonable period, normally about a year.

However, the rule was qualified by the proviso that the union's majority could be challenged within the certification year where "unusual circumstances" were present.
4 While the Board's rule did violence to orthodox principles of agency and on first impression appeared inconsistent with the Wagner Act's guarantee of the right of employees to bargain through representatives of their own choosing, the rule was approved by most of the courts which passed upon it prior to the amendment of the Act in 1947.

The courts found ample justification for the rule.
The Board's election procedure, with its advantage of impartial supervision and its guarantee of anonymity to employees in expressing their choice by secret ballot, had been designed by Congress as the most effective and reliable means of ascertaining the employees' deliberate will.
Thus, when the results of such election had been certified by the Board, it was felt that repudiation of the certified representative should be established only by an equally probative technique.

It was impracticable, however, for the Board to conduct elections to keep pace with every change in the sentiments of the employees in a bargaining unit.
See National Labor Relations Board v. Century Oxford Mfg Co. , supra , 140 F.2d at page 542 ; N.L.R.B.
v. Inter-City Advertising Co. , 4 Cir., 154 F.2d 244, 247 .
The processing of an election, if it were contested, consumed several months.
The Board, therefore, adopted the practice of entertaining petitions for an election in a bargaining unit only after a year had elapsed since the Board's last previous certification of a representative for that unit.
The interval between elections coincided with the period which the Board usually held to be a "reasonable time" for suspension of the power of employees to oust their certified representative.
This did not mean, however, that a representative's authority could be revoked only in a Board-conducted election.
When a reasonable time had elapsed after certification, usually a year, the presumption of the certified union's authority could be rebutted by a showing that the majority of the employees had repudiated the union, whether this choice was made manifest in an election or otherwise.
The Board's rule above referred to was also justified upon the ground that it was necessary to secure stability in bargaining relationships.
As the court said in N.L.R.B.
v. Century Oxford Company , supra , 140 F.2d at page 542 : And in N.L.R.B.
v. Botany Worsted Mills , supra , 133 F.2d at page 881 , it was said, in answer to the argument that employees were free to oust their certified bargaining representative at any time: In N.L.R.B.
v. Appalachian E. Power Co. , supra , the court said, 140 F.2d at page 221 : 5 The Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 (commonly known as the Taft-Hartley Act), like the Wagner Act, is silent as to the effect of a Board certification of a bargaining agent.
However, in passing the Taft-Hartley Act, Congress was fully advised of the binding effect given by the Board and the courts to a Board certification of a representative under the Wagner Act.
With reference to 9(c)(3) of the Senate Bill, now 9(c)(3) of the Act, which provides, inter alia, that elections in any given bargaining unit may be held only once a year, 6 the Senate Report (submitted by Senator Taft) stated: but if it wins its majority cannot be challenged for a year Senator Taft, in explaining 9(c)(3) on the Senate floor, said: He remains the bargaining agent until the end of that year 93 Cong.Rec.
3954 And in the Senate Report (S.Rep.No.
105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 12) it was stated: In order to impress upon employees the solemnity of their choice If a certification was thought to be as meaningless and ephemeral as respondent would have us believe, it is hard to see how employees would approach a Board election with any solemnity, whether the interval between elections be one year or ten.
7 It is plain that Congress, in the course of adopting the 1947 amendments to the Act, was well aware of the rule, adopted and regularly applied by the Board and approved by the courts, making the certification of a bargaining agent binding on the employees represented for a reasonable time.
Under these circumstances it is a fair assumption that by its silence on the question Congress accepted this administrative and judicial construction of the Act.

8 Of the cases arising since the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, all but one appear to approve the rule that the representative status of a certified bargaining agent is beyond challenge for at least a "reasonable time."

v. Vulcan Forging Co. , 6 Cir., 188 F.2d 927 .
In the Vulcan Forging case , supra , which appears to stand alone, the court set aside an order of the Board directing an employer to bargain with the certified bargaining representative where the employees had repudiated the representative just eight days after a Board-conducted election.
The court said, 188 F.2d at page 931 : 9 The language quoted overstates the effect of the rule that the authority of a certified bargaining agent is irrevocable for a "reasonable time."
While under that rule the exercise of the right of employees to oust their representative is suspended for a time, employees are certainly not "deprived" of that right.
And even this temporary suspension of the right is not recognized where unusual circumstances would render it plainly unreasonable or unjust.
The question is whether this limited restriction on the rights of employees is consistent with the policies and provisions of the National Labor Relations Act considered as a whole.
In light of what we consider the manifest intent of Congress, and in accordance with the great weight of judicial authority, we think that it is.
We are of the opinion that the right of employees to bargain through representatives of their own choosing must be, and was intended to be, restricted to the extent necessary to make workable and effective the administrative scheme devised for the protection of that right and for the promotion of the other objectives of the Act.
A primary objective of the Wagner Act, and to an even greater extent the Taft-Hartley Act, was stability in industrial relationships.
To achieve the desired industrial repose "a bargaining relationship once rightfully established must be permitted to exist and function for a reasonable period in which it can be given a fair chance to succeed."
Franks Bros. Co. v. N.L.R.B.
, 321 U.S. 702, 705 , 64 S.Ct. 817, 819 , 88 L.Ed. 1020 ; see N.L.R.B.
v. Prudential Insurance Co. , 6 Cir., 154 F.2d 385, 389 .
If the argument of respondent is accepted, a Board-conducted election and certification, instead of inaugurating a period of industrial repose, would lead only to continued raiding of the bargaining agent's membership and the disrupting influence of rival union activities within the bargaining unit itself.
Employers would be beset by conflicting demands and claims for recognition without a means of determining with certainty whether, or with whom, they should bargain.
Bargaining relationships once established would be subject to destruction upon every volatile whim or caprice and before results could be achieved and judged by the intended beneficiaries.
It was this situation which the provisions for Board-conducted elections were designed to obviate.
We see no reason why this purpose should be frustrated by treating the right of employees to choose their representatives as an absolute, above reasonable restrictions designed to promote "some degree of sobriety and responsibility" in the exercise of that right.
Returning to the facts of the case at bar, it is plain that when the employees repudiated the Union one week after the election a "reasonable time" had not passed to give the bargaining relationship a fair chance to succeed.
No unusual circumstances appear.
Accordingly, the Board was justified in concluding that the Union continued to be the bargaining representative for the employees and that respondent's refusal to bargain constituted an unfair labor practice.
The order of the Board is affirmed and will be enforced.
