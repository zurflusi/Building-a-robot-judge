 BARRETT , Circuit Judge.
The United States, by and through Cecil Andrus, Secretary of the Department of the Interior, et al., (Government) appeals from a summary judgment entered on behalf of Glover Construction Company (Glover), a non-Indian owned contracting company, setting aside and rendering null and void a road construction contract awarded by the Government, through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), to Indian Nations Construction Company (Indian Construction), an Indian owned company.
The contract was let for the reconstruction of five miles of roadway in Pushmataha County, Oklahoma.
The facts are not in dispute.
In March of 1976, Government, through the Commissioner of the BIA, issued a memorandum designated as 20 BIAM Bulletin 1 interpretive of the Buy-Indian Act, 25 U.S.C.A. 47 .
1 The memo provides that bidding on contracts with the BIA is restricted or confined to Indian owned companies.
Non-Indian owned companies are permitted to bid only if Indian owned companies are not available to bid or do not bid.
Prior to May 25, 1977, the BIA invited three Indian owned construction companies to submit bids on a contract for reconstruction of five miles of existing roadway as provided by 41 CFR 1-3.215(a) pursuant to the Buy-Indian Act, supra .
The contract was awarded on May 25, 1977, to Indian Construction, whose bid was $1,219,481.00.
No attempt was made by the Government to publicly advertise for bids pursuant to 41 U.S.C.A. 253 , 2 popularly known as the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, in relation to its application to the relevant provisions of 41 U.S.C.A. 252 .
3 No contentions are advanced by Government that the contract here involved was subject to negotiation under the exceptions of paragraphs (1), (3), (10), (12) or (14) of subsection (c) of 252 , supra .
Glover contends that the Government violated 41 U.S.C.A. 5 which provides that purchases and contracts for supplies or services for the Government may be made or entered into only after advertising a sufficient time previously for proposals, except (1) when the amount involved does not exceed $2,500.00, (2) when the public exigencies require the immediate delivery of the articles or performance of the service, (3) when only one source of supply is available and the Government officer shall so certify, or (4) when the services are required to be performed by the contractor in person and are of a technical or professional nature or under Government supervision and paid for on a time basis.
41 U.S.C.A. 5 was originally enacted in 1946.
60 Stat. 809 .
Further, Glover contends that the Government was required to publicly advertise for bids pursuant to 41 U.S.C.A. 253 , supra , and that the BIA's contracting procedure giving preference to Indians violated Glover's rights to equal protection and due process of law.
The Government contends that the contracting procedure is authorized by the Buy-Indian Act, supra , and that it is constitutional.
The District Court did not reach the constitutional contentions.
The Court did conclude, however, that under the terms of the Federal Property Act, 41 U.S.C.A. 252 , the Buy-Indian Act, 25 U.S.C.A. 47 , could not be applied to road construction contracts; that the contract awarded Indian Construction was null and void; and that the Government (Interior-BIA) should be enjoined from entering into any future road construction contracts without complying with the public advertising requirements.
On appeal, Government contends that the District Court erred in finding and concluding that the BIA (Government) may not enter into road construction contracts with Indian owned contracting companies without publicly advertising for bids pursuant to 41 U.S.C.A. 253 .
The District Court saw the issues framed as follows: In 1976 the BIA implemented its "new" interpretation of the "Buy-Indian Act," supra , (which Act had been in effect since 1910) under which the BIA entered into contractual negotiations with wholly owned Indian companies for road construction projects without complying with the advertising requirements of 41 U.S.C.A. 5 and 253; under the "new" interpretation, bids are to be taken only among Indian owned contracting companies and non-Indian contractors are to be contacted and considered for road construction projects only after it has been determined that there are no qualified Indian contractors within the normal competitive area; Government claims that the "new" policy interpretive of the Buy-Indian Act falls within the "otherwise authorized by law" exception to advertising provided by 41 U.S.C.A. 253(c)(15) ; 4 Glover contends that 41 U.S.C.A. 252(e) fails to exempt contracts for the construction of roads from the advertising requirements, since it expressly exempts 41 U.S.C.A. 252(c)(1) -(3), (10)-(12), and (14) but does not refer to subsection (15); the parties agree that 41 U.S.C.A. 252 and 253 apply to the BIA.
The District Court ruled that the procedure followed by the BIA in awarding the road construction contract to Indian Construction contravenes the requirements of 41 U.S.C.A. 252 and 253.
We agree.
The District Court's order is, in our view, worthy of quotation in pertinent part, to-wit: Section 252(c) subject to the advertising requirements section 253 unless section 252 not without advertising section 253 unless seven subsections section 252(c) not did not intend to save other cases from the operation of the statute Statutes 316 not section 253 section 252(c)(15) Udall v.

1102 Government's main thrust is that the subject contract does fall within the enumerated exceptions to the advertising requirement, and that, in any event, the list of exceptions contained in 41 U.S.C.A. 252(e) was not intended to preclude dispensing with the advertising requirements where independent statutory authority (the Buy-Indian Act) exists.
Inasmuch as the Buy-Indian Act is not mentioned or referred to in the Federal Property Act, the Government argues that ".
.
.
the district court must necessarily have concluded that Section 302(e) of the Federal Property Act, 41 U.S.C. 252(e) , repeated the Buy-Indian Act in regard to construction and repair contracts only by implication."
[Brief of Appellant, p.
8.]
This argument, in our view, "misses the mark."
The District Court made no reference to the rule relating to repeal by implication of law.
The rule does not come into play here simply because, contrary to the Government's claim, nothing in the Buy-Indian Act speaks to or directly mentions roadway construction projects.
The Government thus would have us construe the language in the Buy-Indian Act directing purchase of "Indian supplies" and "products" on the "open market" as directly and unequivocally relating to a contract covering a roadway construction project.
In pressing the point, the Government relies on Bryan v. Itasca County , 426 U.S. 373 , 96 S.Ct. 2102 , 48 L.Ed.2d 710 (1976) and Morton v. Mancari , 417 U.S. 535 , 94 S.Ct. 2474 , 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974) for the rule that statutes passed for the benefit of dependent Indian tribes are to be liberally construed and doubtful expressions resolved in favor of the Indians.
The Morton case involved the issue whether a provision allowing an employment preference to Indians under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 was impliedly repealed by Section 11 of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 42 U.S.C.A. 2000e-16(a) , which provides that all personnel actions affecting employment in most federal agencies must be made free from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.
The Supreme Court held that the latter act did not repeal the former by implication because--and this is critical--the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 was of a longstanding preference and an important component of the Government's Indian policy.
Thus, the Court refused to hold that the provisions of the EEOC Act of 1972 repealed by implication of law the preference provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act.
Significantly, the Supreme Court observed that this could come to pass only if the two statutes are entirely irreconcilable .
Such was not the case in Morton v. Mancari , supra .
The hiring preferences provided for under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 exempted Indians from the Civil Service laws and thus the Act spoke directly to the same subject matter as that addressed in the EEOC Act, i. e., employment by federal agencies.
It would, in our view, require a considerable "stretch of the imagination" to conclude that the Congress intended the Buy-Indian Act to apply to road construction projects.
It is clear, on its face , however, that the Congress did intend that 41 U.S.C.A. 252 and 253 apply to road construction projects.
We agree with Glover's analysis of the "faulty premises" upon which the Government predicates its argument that the contract awarded to Indian Construction was authorized by subsection 15 of Section 252(c) , supra : First Second section 253 Third omits There is nothing in the language of the Buy-Indian Act or its legislative history which suggests that it was intended to apply to roadway construction projects.
As if anticipating the "roadblock" created thereby, the Government attempts to gain a legal "foothold" by relating that the solicitor of the Department of the Interior rendered an opinion on April 27, 1971, entitled "Negotiability of Construction Contracts under the 'Buy-Indian' Act of June 25, 1910" which confirmed the administrative interpretation of the Act going back to about 1961.
This opinion concluded that the enumerated exceptions in 41 U.S.C.A. 252(c) and (e) were not intended to preclude dispensing with public advertising under the authority of the Buy-Indian Act.
The Government states that the District Court failed to give any deference to the Department of the Interior's "long-standing" construction of the Buy-Indian Act.
Our response is that if the Government's administrative interpretation is entitled to the deference urged, the Congress is the branch before whom the point should be pressed.
We have heretofore stated that this Court shall not, under its classical adjudicative power, undertake to legislate.
In conjunction therewith, we have held that statutes are to be construed in a manner so as to effectuate the intent of the enacting body, and that an unambiguous statute must be given its plain and obvious meaning.
United States v. Ray , 488 F.2d 15 (10th Cir. 1973); United States v. Western Pacific Railroad Company , 385 F.2d 161 (10th Cir. 1967), cert. denied , 391 U.S. 919 , 88 S.Ct. 1805 , 20 L.Ed.2d 656 (1968).
When the Congress was dealing with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, 41 U.S.C.A. 252 and 253, it was deemed to be fully cognizant of the Buy-Indian Act of 1910.
The Congress was, accordingly, capable of clearly and directly providing the interpretation of the Buy-Indian Act here urged by the Government.
The fact is that it did not elect to do so.
This Court cannot "fill the gap" by engaging in judicial law-making.
Chavez v. Freshpict Foods, Inc. , 456 F.2d 890 (10th Cir. 1972), cert. denied , 409 U.S. 1042 , 93 S.Ct. 535 , 34 L.Ed.2d 492 (1972); McCord v. Dixie Aviation Corporation , 450 F.2d 1129 (10th Cir. 1971).
In our view, we are here dealing with a political question beyond the jurisdiction of the courts.
Baker v. Carr , 369 U.S. 186 , 82 S.Ct. 691 , 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962).
A statute must be construed as it was intended to be understood when enacted in the light of conditions as they then existed.
United States v. Stewart , 311 U.S. 60 , 61 S.Ct. 102 , 85 L.Ed. 40 (1940).
Assuming, arguendo , the truth of the Government's contention that there were no Indian owned companies engaging in roadway construction in 1910 when the Buy-Indian Act was passed, still we observe that this contention is not advanced in relation to 1949 when the Federal Property Act was passed.
In any event, we do not place particular weight on this matter.
Words of a statute are to be interpreted in their ordinary definitions and in the meanings commonly attributed to them.
Jones v. Liberty Glass Company , 332 U.S. 524 , 68 S.Ct. 229 , 92 L.Ed. 142 (1947).
Even where there are two statutes on the same subject, the earlier being special and the later being general the special act controls as effective and all matters coming within the scope of the special statute are governed by its provisions.
Preiser v. Rodriguez , 411 U.S. 475 , 93 S.Ct. 1827 , 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973); Missouri K & T Ry. Co. v. Jackson , 174 F.2d 297 (10th Cir. 1949); Sutherland, Statutory Construction, 4th Ed., Vol. 2A, 51.05 .
In Sutherland, supra , the rule is stated: Government vigorously contends that its interpretive preference, which led to the grant of the non-competitive award of the roadway construction project to Indian Construction is based upon the remedial aspects of the Buy-Indian Act, to-wit: Furtherance of a ".
.
.
longstanding and important component of the Government's Indian policy designed to enable Indians to obtain jobs without having to compete on equal terms with non-Indians."
[Brief of Appellants, p.
9.]
We recognize that the remedial Buy-Indian Act is to be given a liberal construction in order to effectuate the purpose for which it was enacted.
Sutherland, Statutory Construction, 4th Ed., Vol. 3, 60.01 .
Even so, we believe that it strains the most liberal interpretation to conclude that the Act's preference for purchase of "Indian supplies" and "products" applies to a roadway reconstruction project whose contract price, through Indian Construction, is $1,219,481.00.
The strain is the more "painful" when we consider that the Government engineer's estimate for the project was $963,117.48 and that Glover completed the first five miles of the reconstruction project, under normal competitive bidding procedures, for $538,000.00.
While we do not represent or pretend that these comparative figures control in determining the reasonableness of the Indian Construction non-competitive contract price of $1,219,481.00, we do observe that a primary, significant remedial feature of the advertisement and competitive bidding requirements of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 is to obtain the best and lowest bid for the benefit of the American taxpayers in "high cost" construction categories.
In that sense we observe that this Court has held that a statutory exception should be strictly construed so that the exception does not devour the general policy which the law embodies.

WE AFFIRM.
