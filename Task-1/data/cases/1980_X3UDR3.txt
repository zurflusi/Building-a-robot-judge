 STEPHENSON , Circuit Judge.
The National Gerimedical Hospital, plaintiff-appellant, appeals from a summary judgment granted to defendant-appellee Blue Cross of Kansas City.
National had charged Blue Cross and others 1 with violations of sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1 and 2.
The trial court 2 found Blue Cross' activities to be taken pursuant to Public Law 93-641, the National Health Care Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. 300k , et seq.
; that there was a repugnancy between the Act and the antitrust laws; and that consequently, under the doctrine of implied immunity, Blue Cross' activities were immune from the antitrust laws.
National Gerimedical Hospital & Gerontology Center v. Blue Cross , 479 F.Supp.
1012 (W.D.Mo.1979).
We affirm the district court.
I. Statutory Background The related health care statutes, as they existed during the relevant time period, are as follows.
Prior to the National Health Care Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974, the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 291 , et seq.
(known as the Hill-Burton Act) was the primary legislation channeling federal funds to states in support of construction and modernization of health care facilities.
The Hill-Burton Act provides, as does much federal legislation involving state cooperation, for voluntary participation by the states.
The participating state submits a state plan to HEW, which designates a particular state agency to be in charge of administering the state program and determining, inter alia , the need for new or expanded health care facilities.
While an applicant could build without approval by the state agency, such applicant would not be eligible for reimbursement by the federal government.
Lakeside Mercy Hospital, Inc. v. Indiana State Board of Health , 421 F.Supp.
193, 196-97 (N.D.Ind.1976).
Other prior legislation providing for channeling federal funds into health care programs includes the Public Health Service Act 314 , 42 U.S.C. 246 (amended 1978 and 1979).
Under this program, federal funds are channeled to participating states that submit, and have approved by HEW, a Comprehensive Health Planning State Plan.
This legislation provides for a state agency to be designated to screen health care applications in order to verify the need for new facilities and programs under the approved state plan, and also, in cooperation with the state agency, the Act provides for Area Comprehensive Health Planning Agencies.
Id. at 197 .
Section 1122 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-1 (amended 1978 and 1979), enacted in 1972, provides for a participating state program for repayment provisions for Medicaid and Medicare, for which repayment prior to that time had not been dependent upon need approval by any of the various state health agencies (those designated by the state pursuant to compliance with federal requirements in order to be a participating state.)
Section 1122 of the Social Security Act authorizes HEW to enter into agreements with participating states whereby a state agency is designated as a health planning agency.
This agency develops a state plan and makes recommendations as to the need of proposed expenditures for health care facilities, in conformity with regulations promulgated by HEW.
Once final approval by HEW is received, the capital expenditure qualifies for purposes of reimbursement, via Medicaid and Medicare payments, the portion of fees allocable to return of depreciation, debt service and other capital related expenditures.
Id .
The purpose of the National Health Care Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974, also providing for a participating state program, is "to facilitate the development of recommendations for a national health planning policy, to augment area-wide and State planning for health services, manpower, and facilities, and to authorize financial assistance for the development of resources to further that policy."
42 U.S.C. 300k(b) .
Part B of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 300 l et seq., provides for the establishment of health service areas and corresponding health systems agencies (HSAs).
The purposes of the HSAs as stated in the Act include, inter alia , "preventing unnecessary duplication of health resources."
42 U.S.C. 300l-2(a) .
In order to accomplish its purposes, the HSA is to establish a health systems plan (HSP) and an annual implementation plan (AIP) which will achieve the goals of the HSP.
42 U.S.C. 300l-2(b)(2) .
The Act specifically provides that the HSA shall implement the HSP and AIP, and " shall seek, to the extent practicable, to implement its HSP and AIP with the assistance of individuals and public and private entities in its health service area."
42 U.S.C. 300l-2(c)(1) (emphasis added).
It is this section of the Act upon which the district court primarily rests its finding of antitrust immunity for the actions of Blue Cross.
II.
Facts Construction of the National Gerimedical Hospital began in August 1976 and was completed in September 1978.
On October 4, 1977, National submitted to Blue Cross a request for a member hospital contract.
Pursuant to such contracts Blue Cross reimburses individual members the cost of all covered health services received at member hospitals.
If health services are received by individual members at non-member hospitals, Blue Cross individual members receive only up to eighty percent of the cost of the covered medical services.
Also, for health services received at member hospitals, Blue Cross reimburses or pays the hospital for the services provided its individual members; with a non-member hospital, the reimbursement is paid to the individual member, not to the hospital.
Blue Cross advised National that National must first secure need approval of Mid-America Health Services Agency (MAHSA) in order to be eligible for favorable consideration by Blue Cross for a member hospital contract.
MAHSA, named as a non-defendant alleged coconspirator, 3 is a private not-for-profit Missouri corporation engaged in voluntary health planning.
MAHSA was conditionally designated an HSA under the Act and was notified of its designation for the eight county bi-state region of the metropolitan Kansas City area by letter from HEW on April 7, 1976.
Mid-America Regional Council v. Mathews , 416 F.Supp.
896, 899 (W.D.Mo.1976).
Thus during the relevant time period of this case, MAHSA enjoyed this status.
Prior to this time period, Missouri had participated in the Social Security Act 1122 Capital Health Care Expenditures Program, which included a State Planning Agency that performed section 1122 program reviews, as discussed infra .
42 U.S.C. 1320a-1 (amended 1978 and 1979).
Blue Cross had required that large capital expenditures be approved by the local and regional planning arm of the section 1122 State Planning Agency before, i. e. , a hospital could be a member institute.
This Capital Expenditure Program, as discussed infra , was designed to assure that federal funds appropriated for Medicaid and Medicare were not used to support unnecessary capital expenditures for health care facilities.
Area agencies established under 42 U.S.C. 246 (amended 1978 and 1979), discussed infra , Area Comprehensive Health Planning Agencies (CHPs), were used in conjunction with the need approvals necessary under 42 U.S.C. 1320a-1 (amended 1978 and 1979).
The applicant for Medicaid and Medicare cost reimbursement had to seek a favorable recommendation from the CHP and secure a favorable determination of need from the state planning agency, the Missouri State Health Planning and Development Agency.
The CHP for Missouri was MAHSA.
The National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974 gives preference to 246 area agencies, CHPs and existing regional planning areas.
42 U.S.C. 300l -4(b)(4) and 300l(a) (4).
On June 30, 1976, Missouri, a participating state under 42 U.S.C. 1320a-1 (amended 1978 and 1979) since 1973, refused to renew Missouri's contract with HEW and Missouri's Program for Capital Health Care Expenditures was terminated.
On July 21, 1976, as reflected by a "Special Newsletter" to Blue Cross member hospitals in Missouri, Blue Cross gave notice that all projects in the Kansas City metropolitan area not reviewed and approved by MAHSA would not be reimbursable by Blue Cross of Kansas City. 4 All projects not reviewed and approved by these Health Systems Agencies will not be reimbursable by Blue Cross of Kansas City MAHSA was, of course, designated as the HSA under the Act.
However, Missouri, during the relevant time period, had no law implementing the Act in Missouri nor designating any state agency thereunder in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 300m .
MAHSA had publicly stated that it would disapprove and not consider favorably the addition of any acute care hospital beds; acute care hospital beds are the type National provided; National did not submit an application for need review to MAHSA; National's application for a member contract with Blue Cross was denied in March 1978 by Blue Cross because National had not received approval through the voluntary health planning process as required by the Special Newsletter.
National then filed this lawsuit.
III.
Analysis National argues that by requiring National to get need approval from MAHSA before it applies for a member hospital contract with Blue Cross, Blue Cross violates the antitrust laws.
National contends that the requirement constitutes a contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade, Sherman Act 1 , 15 U.S.C. 1 , and an abuse of Blue Cross' monopoly power in the private health care reimbursement plan market, Sherman Act 2 , 15 U.S.C. 2 .
What defeats National's otherwise appealing argument are the specific provisions of the National Health Planning Resources Development Act for voluntary cooperation and assistance of private entities and persons in the community and health care market.
While the doctrine of implied immunity is to be used sparingly and only when necessary, Gordon v. New York Stock Exchange, Inc. , 422 U.S. 659 , 95 S.Ct. 2598 , 45 L.Ed.2d 463 (1975), these provisions make the instant situation one well-suited for its use.
The necessity of application of the doctrine of implied immunity arises if there is (1) a clear repugnancy between the antitrust laws and the specific conduct at issue and (2) if the intent of Congress is that implied repeal of the antitrust laws was intended.
Essential Communication Systems, Inc. v. AT&T , 446 F.Supp.
1090, 1094-95 (D.N.J.1978), rev'd , 610 F.2d 1114 (3d Cir. 1979) (holding no implied immunity).
As to the first prerequisite, the district court herein stated its finding of repugnancy best when it stated: National Gerimedical Hospital & Gerontology Center v. Blue Cross , supra , 479 F.Supp.
1012, 1021 (W.D.Mo.1979).
National's emphasis upon the fact that Missouri was not a participating state--"at all times here pertinent, Missouri had no law implementing P.L.
93-641 in Missouri nor designating any state agency thereunder in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 300m " (brief for appellant at 12-13)--misses the focus of the doctrine of implied immunity.
The doctrine should not be confused with the state action exemption to the antitrust laws as articulated in Parker v. Brown , 317 U.S. 341 , 63 S.Ct. 307 , 37 L.Ed. 315 (1943).
The doctrine of implied immunity, in fact, See Gordon v. N. Y. Stock Exchange 422 U.S. 659, 682 95 S.Ct. 2598 45 L.Ed.2d 463 U. S. v. Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference 439 F.Supp.
29, 35 Essential Communication Systems, Inc. v. AT&T , supra , 446 F.Supp.
at 1094 (footnote omitted) Missouri's lack of state participation did not affect the Act which set up a regulatory scheme which designated MAHSA as a regulatory need review agency.
More specifically, it has no effect upon that portion of the legislation which calls for a regulatory system which included the designated HSA implementing the HSP and AIP "with the assistance of individuals and public and private entities in its health service area."
42 U.S.C. 300l-2(c)(1) .
The extent of this regulatory scheme is demonstrated by the district court's discussion.
Objective # 4 National Gerimedical Hospital & Gerontology Center v. Blue Cross , supra , 479 F.Supp.
at 1020-21 .
Implied immunity can be found in "particular and discrete instances to assure that the federal agency entrusted with regulation in the public interest could carry out that responsibility free from the disruption of conflicting judgments that might be voiced by courts exercising jurisdiction under the antitrust laws."
United States v. National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. , 422 U.S. 694, 734 , 95 S.Ct. 2427, 2450 , 45 L.Ed.2d 486 (1975).
We agree with the district court's finding of clear repugnancy between the Act and the antitrust laws, as the Act and regulatory scheme clearly call for the action which has now become the basis of an antitrust claim.
We now examine the history of the Act in order to determine the congressional intent in regard to immunity.
The district court concluded, after a thorough review of the legislative history, that it was the intent of Congress to immunize this type of voluntary action from the antitrust laws.
We cannot improve on the district court's discussion: National Gerimedical Hospital & Gerontology Center v. Blue Cross , supra , 479 F.Supp.
at 1021-23 .
We adopt the district court's discussion, as set out above.
We affirm the district court's holding; the doctrine of implied immunity applies to Blue Cross' voluntary cooperation with the congressionally designated HSA in requiring National to obtain need approval from MAHSA prior to applying for a Blue Cross membership contract.
Appellee Blue Cross also argues that the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. 1011-15 , exempts the challenged conduct from the federal antitrust laws.
We agree, in all respects, with the district court's holding that Group Life & Health Insurance Co. v. Royal Drug Co., Inc. , 440 U.S. 205 , 99 S.Ct. 1067 , 59 L.Ed.2d 261 (1979) (defining "the business of insurance" in connection with the McCarran-Ferguson Act) controls.
National Gerimedical Hospital & Gerontology Center v. Blue Cross , supra , 479 F.Supp.
at 1016-19 .
Thus, we hold that the McCarran-Ferguson Act insurance exemption is not applicable in this case. The district court is affirmed.
