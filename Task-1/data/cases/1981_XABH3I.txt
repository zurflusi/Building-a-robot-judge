 POLITZ , Circuit Judge: The sole issue in this case is the constitutionality vel non of Tex.Educ.Code Ann. tit. 2, 21.031(d) (Vernon Supp. 1978), which provides: not for the primary purpose of attending the public free schools Appellants are United States citizens between five and eighteen years of age, not living with their parents or legal guardians, who have chosen to live in a school district for the primary purpose of attending its free public schools.
They were denied tuition-free admission to the public schools because of the strictures of the challenged statute.
The district court, 482 F.Supp.
212 , upheld the statute.
We affirm.
The original complaint was filed as a class action, but this aspect was eliminated by an amended complaint.
Only two of the original plaintiffs remain, Roberto Morales and Rita Gomez.
1 It is contended that 21.031(d) of the Texas Education Code violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment of the Constitution.
Appellants argue that the challenged statute, as applied, results in invidious discrimination against Mexican-Americans, violating their right to equal protection.
The Supreme Court has found classifications based on race or alienage inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny.
Graham v. Richardson , 403 U.S. 365, 371-72 , 91 S.Ct. 1848, 1851-1852 , 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971).
Were this statute to be so classified, it would be subjected to strict judicial scrutiny and would not be upheld unless a compelling state interest were shown.
San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez , 411 U.S. 1 , 93 S.Ct. 1278 , 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973).
We do not address this question because discriminatory application is not alleged in the amended complaint.
The issue may not be revived on appeal.
Appellants assert a second ground for application of the compelling interest test--the statute improperly burdens the fundamental right of interstate travel.
Strict judicial scrutiny is also appropriate in those situations in which a constitutionally protected right is infringed.
San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez , 411 U.S. at 40 , 93 S.Ct. at 1300 .
Although not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, the right to interstate travel has been repeatedly recognized as a basic right, fundamental to the concept of our federal union.
United States v. Guest , 383 U.S. 745, 757-58 , 86 S.Ct. 1170, 1177-1178 , 16 L.Ed.2d 239 (1966).
We recognize that the statutory definition of residency in 21.031(d) denies tuition-free admission to public school to those whose presence in the school district is primarily for that purpose.
All residency requirements, however, are not unconstitutional.
The Supreme Court has distinguished between residency requirements and durational residency requirements, finding only the latter violative of the right to travel.
See McCarthy v. Philadelphia Civil Service Commission , 424 U.S. 645 , 96 S.Ct. 1154 , 47 L.Ed.2d 366 (1976).
Based on this distinction, the district court declined to apply the strict scrutiny standard, requiring instead that the statute be supported by minimum rationality and, on that basis, found the statute constitutional.
We agree in principle with the district court's analysis of the right to interstate travel.
Nevertheless, we defer the determination whether the strict scrutiny or rational basis yardstick should be applied for under either measure Texas' interests in enacting the statute are sufficient.
We need not decide whether in another instance involving a similar statute a legitimate state interest alone would suffice.
We are in accord with the district court's articulation of the state's interests, expressed as follows: "A state has a legitimate interest in protecting and preserving the quality of its educational system and the right of its own bona fide residents to attend state schools on a preferred tuition basis.
Vlandis v. Kline , [ 412 U.S. 441, 452-53 , 93 S.Ct. 2230, 2236-2237 , 37 L.Ed.2d 63 (1973)].
Similarly, the state would have an interest in preserving the financial integrity of the various components of the state educational system, i. e. , the individual school districts.
East Texas Guidance and Achievement Center, Inc. v. Brockette , 431 F.Supp.
231, 236 (E.D.Tex.1977) [T]he statute on its face [applies] to children of parents living anywhere in Texas or in any of the United States.
Since the statute applies to any minor student living apart from his parents, guardian or other person with lawful control, it even applies to attempted transfers between different school districts within the same county.
The Court is satisfied that these kinds of transfers, free of all tuition, would cause budgetary and administrative planning problems sufficient to justify the tuition scheme of the statute.
As stated in DeLeon v. Harlingen Consolidated Independent School District , [ 552 S.W.2d 922 (Tex.Civ.App.--Corpus Christi 1977, no writ)]: 552 S.W.2d at 925
