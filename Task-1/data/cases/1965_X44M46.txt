 EDWARDS , Circuit Judge.
Defendant appeals from his conviction before a United States District Court jury in Nashville, Tennessee, on one of two counts charging him with the crime of jury tampering.
He was sentenced to three and one-half years in the federal penitentiary.
Defendant had been indicted on three counts of violating 18 U.S.C. 1503 .
Count One of the indictment charged that appellant in November 1963 "did request, counsel, and direct" one Robert D. Vick to contact Ralph A. Elliott, who was and known to be a member of the petit jury panel from which jurors were to be drawn for a pending case, "and to offer and promise to pay the said Ralph A. Elliott $10,000 to induce the said Elliott to vote for an acquittal" if Elliott were to be selected as a juror for that trial, this in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1503 .
Count Two charged a similar offense in November 1962 in relation to the "Test Fleet" trial, the request being alleged to have been made to a lawyer named Beard to approach D. M. Harrison, the husband of a sitting juror.
Defendant was convicted on Count One and acquitted on Count Two.
The third count had been dismissed before trial.
At the time of the events in question, defendant was a prominent and successful lawyer who had handled a good deal of important litigation.
Just before the happenings which led to this indictment, he had served (and was serving) as local counsel for defendant James R. Hoffa in United States v. James R. Hoffa & Commercial Carriers, Inc. (Criminal No. 13,241, United States District Court, Middle District of Tennessee, Nashville Division) (the so-called "Test Fleet" case) wherein his client had been the subject of mistrial resulting from a divided or "hung" jury.
Subsequent to the conclusion of the "Test Fleet" case, evidence was presented to a federal grand jury which resulted in the indictment of Hoffa and a number of other defendants on charges of jury tampering pertaining to alleged approaches to the "Test Fleet" case jury.
United States v. Hoffa, et al.
, D.C., 235 F.Supp.
611 (United States District Court, Eastern District of Tennessee, Southern Division, at Chattanooga).
See 349 F.2d 20 (C.A. 6, 1965) This Hoffa jury tampering case was originally scheduled to be tried in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, Nashville, Tennessee, and it was expected that the jury panel for that District would be the panel from which the Hoffa, et al., jury tampering case would be chosen.
Prior to the transfer of the United States v. Hoffa, et al., trial on jury tampering to Chattanooga, Tennessee, the Federal Bureau of Investigation called to the attention of two of the United States District Judges for the Middle District of Tennessee (Judges Miller and Gray) that an informant, one Vick, had brought them charges to the effect that Hoffa's local counsel, defendant herein, was seeking to make contact through intermediaries with prospective members of the Hoffa, et al., jury.
Vick was an officer of the Nashville Police Department whom defendant had employed during the "Test Fleet" trial to investigate jurors.
The two District Judges, although openly skeptical of the information, authorized the informant to seek further conversation with defendant, carrying on his person a recording device by which they, the judges, would later be able to hear what transpired.
Vick twice talked with appellant with the recording device concealed on him, but it twice failed to operate.
On the third occasion the recorder did operate and the tape thus produced resulted in such confirmation of Vick's information as to occasion appellant's disbarment in the federal courts and the indictment in the present case. At trial of the presently considered charges Vick testified and the recording of the last of his conversations with appellant was introduced in corroboration.
Vick testified that his representations to appellant concerning conversations with and willingness to bribe prospective juror Elliott were false.
At the time they were made, Vick, indicated he was reporting to FBI and Justice Department personnel.
The jury also heard defendant's admission that the transcript of this recording was "substantially correct."
Since on this appeal defendant's primary appellate issue is a claim of legal entrapment, we feel it relevant to reproduce the record of this conversation in its entirety: The courts have repeatedly held that a recording of a conversation made by one party in the presence of but without the knowledge of another party, may be admitted in evidence to corroborate the testimony of the party who makes the record.

United States , 327 F.2d 825 (C.A.9, 1964).
The principal limitation on this holding pertains to establishing the authenticity and the accuracy of the record.
In the instant case the authenticity and accuracy of the quoted transcript is conceded.
In United States v. Miller , 316 F.2d 81 (C.A.6, 1963), this court specifically declined to hold inadmissible evidence of government agents based on their hearing a radio transmission of a conversation by use of a transmitter (Fargo device) secreted on the person of one of the parties.
The statute under which this case was tried provides as follows: 18 U.S.C. 1503 This statute mirrors the national concern with preserving the integrity of the jury trial as the cornerstone of this nation's criminal law.
Under its terms it is obvious that Congress has intended not merely to make successful bribing of a juror a crime, but likewise to make it a criminal offense to do any act which has the ultimate bribing of a juror as its purpose.
Defendant herein contends first, that what he did, did not constitute violation of this statute, and second that if it did, he was entrapped into doing it.
The principal interpretations of this statute have been made by the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Russell , 255 U.S. 138 , 41 S.Ct. 260 , 65 L.Ed. 553 (1921); Sorrells v. United States , 287 U.S. 435 , 53 S.Ct. 210 , 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932); and Sherman v. United States , 356 U.S. 369 , 78 S.Ct. 819 , 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958).
(See also United States v. Gosser , 339 F.2d 102 (C.A.6, 1964)).
In these cases the following principles were laid down pertaining to the substantive offense and to the defense of legal entrapment.
In Russell we find this definition of the key word "endeavor."
United States v. Russell supra 255 U.S. at 143 41 S.Ct. at 261 In Sherman we find this discussion of entrapment: predisposition' Sherman v. United States supra 356 U.S. at 372-373 78 S.Ct. at 821 And in Sorrells we find these crucial distinctions: Grimm v. United States 156 U.S. 604, 610 15 S.Ct. 470 39 L.Ed. 550 Goode v. United States 159 U.S. 663, 669 16 S.Ct. 136 40 L.Ed. 297 Rosen v. United States 161 U.S. 29, 42 16 S.Ct. 434, 480 40 L.Ed. 606 Andrews v. United States 162 U.S. 420, 423 16 S.Ct. 798 40 L.Ed. 1023 Price v. United States 165 U.S. 311, 315 17 S.Ct. 366 41 L.Ed. 727 Bates v. United States 10 F. 92, 94 United States v. Reisenweber 288 F. 520, 526 Aultman v. United States 289 F. 251 Sorrells v. United States supra 287 U.S. at 441-442 53 S.Ct. at 212-213 In the evidence which we have set forth, we find ample grounds for affirmance of this jury verdict.
We are fully convinced that telling a third party to offer a bribe to a potential juror is a corrupt "endeavor to influence" within the meaning of the statute.
18 U.S.C. 1503 .
We do not believe that this act is insulated from prosecution by failure, or by lack of actual intent on the part of the third party ever to make the approach.
The falsity of Vick's statement pertaining to Elliott closely parallels the situation in Lopez, where the Supreme Court said: Wong Sun v. United States 371 U.S. 471 83 S.Ct. 407 9 L.Ed.2d 441 Gouled v. United States 255 U.S. 298 41 S.Ct. 261 65 L.Ed. 647 Lopez v. United States supra 373 U.S. at 438 83 S.Ct. at 1387 Further, we find ample evidence to support this jury's rejection of the defense of entrapment.
This transcript does not mirror the inducing of an unwilling party to commit a crime.
This recorded conversation could have convinced the jury that defendant was a fully informed and eager jury tamperer, ready to seize the opportunity which he saw provided by Vick.
It seems significant to us that defendant was the first to name the juror supposed to be bribed; that after ascertaining that Vick had "gone pretty far," it was he who thought it might be desirable to move the conversation out of his office, presumably for the purpose of greater security; that it was he who decided that Vick should employ no intermediary in his contacts with the Elliott family, and that it was he who insisted that Elliott had to be chosen on the jury before the deal was complete or any money would be due.
Further, we regard the following portion of the transcript as peculiarly invulnerable to the interpretation that defendant had been reluctantly induced and entrapped into participation in a jury tampering scheme not resulting from his own plans and desires: In saying what we have said, we do not ignore the fact that defendant's principal point pertaining to entrapment concerns his argument that in conversations prior to this one he had effectively been induced to participate in the scheme which involved the proposed bribing of Elliott.
His testimony pertaining to these prior unrecorded conversations with Vick was evidence which the jury, if convinced of its accuracy, could have held to represent entrapment.
But defendant's version of these prior conversations was not undisputed; Vick's testimony as to them was substantially different.
Generally, disputed fact questions concerning entrapment are for the jury to resolve.
Sorrells v. United States , supra ; Sherman v. United States , supra , 356 U.S. at 377 , n. 8, 78 S.Ct. 819 , And here there is undisputed evidence (in the evidence just quoted) from which the jury could have found that at most what the alleged entrapper did (at least on the last visit) was to provide "opportunity" for violation of the law.
We certainly do not find here undisputed evidence of a case where: Sherman v. United States supra at 376 78 S.Ct. at 822 In defendant's brief much is made of the evil character of the informer, Vick.
Vick's willingness to change sides from law enforcement to law violation, depending upon the inducement offered, seems apparent to us--as it doubtless did to the jury.
While this moral flexibility was obviously one of the material issues bearing on the credibility of his testimony, it did not prevent jury consideration of that testimony--particularly where, as here, much of the testimony was corroborated by other evidence.
United States v. Thomas , 342 F.2d 132 (C.A.6, 1965).
Defendant's protests about the unreliability of Vick are diminished in force by substantial corroboration of the most damaging of Vick's testimony.
It must also be remembered that in the first instance he chose Vick to work for him on a jury investigation in a criminal case, well-knowing his police employment 2 and his reputation.
And the credibility of defendant's own testimony was greatly damaged, as compared to his prior reputation, by the fact that he lied repeatedly under oath before the two District Judges about knowing anything at all about the Elliott approaches until he was confronted by the record of his own voice.
Further, as opposed to defendant's own testimony as to the nature of these unrecorded conversations, the jury had an opportunity to see and hear the testimony of the defendant and his accuser, Vick.
The jury could, and doubtless did, compare the relative intelligence and determination and character and experience and legal training and knowledge of the two in determining whether or not Vick would be likely (as defendant claims) successfully to induce and entrap him.
Our review of the record indicates that there was evidence which required the United States District Judge to submit the case for jury decision.
Our review of the jury charge indicates that the issue of entrapment was properly submitted to this jury.
No challenge is brought to us pertaining to the impartiality of the jury which actually tried this case nor to the events of the trial itself.
Defendant made no motion for change of venue.
We are, however, confronted by a challenge to the composition and the impartiality of the grand jury which found the instant indictment.
It is claimed that this grand jury was illegally impaneled and was preconditioned by preindictment publicity so as to deprive defendant of due process in its consideration of the government's evidence upon which the indictment was issued.
The first of these issues has been recently and carefully considered by this court, and decided adversely to appellant's claims.
United States v. Hoffa, et al.
, 349 F.2d 20 (C.A.6, 1965).
Although this case was before another panel of the court, we concur in the views therein expressed pertaining to the composition of this grand jury.
Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S. 202 , 85 S.Ct. 824 , 13 L.Ed.2d 759 (1965).
On the issue of appellant's claim of prejudice resulting from preindictment publicity and alleged failures of the judge properly to screen the grand jury panel for bias, we find no grounds for reversal.
Mr. Justice Black's opinion in Costello v. United States , 350 U.S. 359 , 76 S.Ct. 406 , 100 L.Ed. 397 (1956) indicates the limited nature of appellate review of grand jury indictment proceedings.
Much of Mr. Justice Clark's majority opinion in Beck v. Washington , 369 U.S 541 , 82 S.Ct. 955 , 8 L.Ed.2d 98 (1962), could be read as directly applicable to the instant case: Hurtado v California 110 U.S. 516 4 S.Ct. 292 28 L.Ed. 232 Ocampo v. United States 234 U.S. 91 34 S.Ct. 712 58 L.Ed. 1231 Lem Woon v. Oregon 229 U.S 586 33 S.Ct. 783 57 L.Ed. 1340 voir dire Lawn v. United States 355 U.S. 339, 349-350 78 S.Ct. 311, 317-318 2 L.Ed.2d 321 Costello v. United States 350 U.S. 359, 363 76 S.Ct. 406, 408 100 L.Ed 397 Hoffman v. United States 341 U.S. 479, 485 71 S.Ct. 814, 817 95 L.Ed. 1118 Beck v. Washington supra at 545-546 82 S.Ct. at 957-958 We hold that here, too, as in Beck, the appellant has not borne "the burden of showing essential unfairness" in relation to his indictment.
Beck v. Washington , supra 369 U.S. at 558 , 82 S.Ct. at 964 .
The essential conflict of evidence developed in this trial pertaining to Count One concerned the initial conversations between Vick and defendant about prospective juror Elliott.
Defendant's testimony varied in a number of respects (bearing on the defense of entrapment) from Vick's direct testimony.
In this situation the appearance of the two District Judges to identify the Vick affidavit (upon which they authorized further investigation by use of a recording device) and the admission of the affidavit itself, were not reversible error.
The affidavit was a prior record of a statement by Vick consistent with his direct testimony which defendant had attacked.
The District Judge held that the affidavit and the circumstances surrounding its origin and use were proper rebuttal.
We find no abuse of discretion or reversible error in this ruling.
Goldsby v. United States , 160 U.S. 70 , 16 S.Ct. 216 , 40 L.Ed. 343 (1895); United States v. Alaimo , 297 F.2d 604 (C.A.3, 1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 817 , 82 S.Ct. 829 , 7 L.Ed.2d 784 (1962).
In this case at the conclusion of Judge Boyd's charge both sides stated that they had no exceptions to the jury instructions as given.
We have reviewed the claims of error in the charge as given which defendant's counsel now presents on appeal and find no example of "plain error" therein.
Rule 52(b) Fed.R.Crim.P.
Taking the charge as a whole and its paragraphs in their proper context, we find the charge essentially fair.
As to the instructions submitted by defendant but denied or not employed by the District Judge, we find no reversible error.
In most instances cited the instruction was properly covered in the Judge's own language.
Under the evidence in this case we do not believe that defendant was entitled to defendant's proffered instructions No. 4 or No. 24.
Defendant's proffered instruction No. 4 would have told the jury that they could not consider any evidence offered pertaining to one count in determining the truth or falsity of the other count.
This instruction was not given and the District Judge did charge "that an existing disposition to commit a similar offense is an important factor to consider in determining whether there was a subsequent entrapment."
We believe that where entrapment is offered as a defense, that this charge is a proper one.
Knight v. United States , 310 F.2d 305 (C.A.5, 1962).
Here evidence pertaining to Count Two was such that the jury might have concluded that defendant rejected the opportunity to make a bribe attempt largely because he deemed it impractical and unlikely to succeed, rather than because he rejected the whole idea.
Defendant's own testimony concerning his conversations with Henry Beard pertaining to juror, Mrs. Harrison, and his subsequent employment of Beard for reporting on jury panel members' backgrounds is hardly consistent with the argument of innocent gullibility which defendant proffered to the jury.
We do not believe that the judge's refusal to instruct that the jury could not consider the testimony pertaining to Count Two (in the event they rendered a Not Guilty verdict thereon) was error.
We find no other issues of substance on this appeal and our review of the record does not disclose any reversible error.
Affirmed.
