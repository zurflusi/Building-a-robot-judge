 PARKER , Chief Judge.
These are appeals from judgments in actions instituted under the Federal False Claims Act, R.S.
3490 , 5438, 31 U.S.C.A. 231 .
In No. 7224 the action was grounded on false representations made in obtaining the guaranty by the Federal Housing Administration of loans made to defendants by a bank.
Judgment was entered for defendants and the United States has appealed.
See United States v. McNinch , D.C., 138 F.Supp.
711 .
In the other two cases, action was grounded on false representations made to the Commodity Credit Corporation for the purpose of obtaining loans on cotton.
Judgment was entered in favor of the United States for the $2,000 forfeiture provided by statute as to a number of transactions and the defendants have appealed.
The cases are considered together, as the controlling question in all of them is the applicability of the False Claims Act to claims against government corporations as distinguished from claims against the government itself or "any department or officer thereof."
In No. 7224 the facts are that two of the defendants were officers and one a salesman of an unincorporated home construction business.
They presented to a bank, which was an approved FHA lending institution, eleven fraudulent FHA loan applications for the purpose of obtaining FHA-insured home improvement loans in behalf of home-owner customers with whom they had contracted to carry out home improvements.
The bank made the loans, which were then insured by the FHA pursuant to Title I of the National Housing Act.
12 U.S.C.A. 1701 et seq.
Prior to the institution of this proceeding, two of the defendants pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. 1010 , which prohibits the making of false statements for the purpose of obtaining FHA-insured loans.
In No. 7321 the facts are that defendants were engaged in the cotton business.
Desiring to obtain non-recourse loans on cotton which they purchased in the course of their business, they caused eighty-two producers' notes and loan agreements to be signed by producers of cotton and used them to obtain loans under the Cotton Loan Program from the Commodity Credit Corporation, pledging as security cotton belonging, not to the producers who signed the notes, but to the defendants.
The holding of the court was that each note constituted a false claim under the statute and judgment was entered against the defendant Toepleman for the sum of $2,000 as to each note, or a total of $164,000, subject to a credit of $2,000.
Defendant Toepleman paid 39 of the notes and redeemed the cotton thereunder.
The remaining 43 notes were not paid on maturity and the cotton pledged to secure same was sold by the government at a loss of $6,733.97.
Toepleman appealed from the judgment for $162,000 and the United States filed a cross appeal from the refusal of the judge to render judgment for double the amount of the $6,733.97 loss sustained on the sale of the cotton.
In No. 7333, the facts are that the defendants obtained loans on cotton from the Commodity Credit Corporation in 30 separate transactions embracing notes which contained the false representation that they were made by the producers of the cotton.
Judgment was rendered against the defendants for $60,000, representing a forfeiture of $2,000 as to each transaction; and from this portion of the judgment defendants have appealed.
Judgment was rendered in favor of defendants for $1,150.24 on a counterclaim relating to an entirely different matter, and from this portion of the judgment no appeal was taken.
The important question presented by all of the appeals is whether the forfeiture of $2,000 imposed by the False Claims Act applies where the claims are made, not directly against the government or against "any department or officer" of the government, but against a corporation as a governmental agency.
We think that, in the light of the language used in the statute, as well as in the light of legislative history, this question must be answered in the negative.
The authoritative text of the False Claims Act is to be found in Section 3490 of the Revised Statutes of 1878, which is as follows: This section has never been amended, although R.S.
5438 has been amended.
Prior to the amendment of R.S.
5438 , the pertinent portion of that section, incorporated by reference in R.S.
3490 , was as follows: upon or against the Government of the United States, or any department or officer thereof such claim Government of the United States or any department or officer thereof, by obtaining or aiding to obtain the payment or allowance of any false or fraudulent claim In 1918, section 5438 , then appearing as section 35 of the Criminal Code, was amended by adding to the list of those to whom it was made criminal to present a false claim "any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder".
Like language was added to the description of the claim.
40 Stat. 1015 .
The purpose of the amendment was to extend the criminal provision of the section so as to protect government corporations, i. e. corporations in which the government was a stockholder and in reality the owner of the corporate business and property.
See United States v. Bowman , 260 U.S. 94 , 43 S.Ct. 39 , 67 L.Ed. 149 and H.R.Report No. 668, 65th Cong. 2d Sess.
and 56 Cong.Rec.
pp.
11, 118-11, 119.
The section as amended was carried forward and reenacted as section 287 of Title 18 of the United States Code, making it a crime to present a false claim against "The United States, or any department or agency thereof."
(Italics supplied.)
This language, of course, makes the criminal statute applicable to false claims against government corporations, since "agency" is defined in 18 U.S.C. 6 as including "any corporation in which the United States has a proprietary interest."
There has been no amendment of the civil provisions contained in R.S.
3490 , extending their coverage to false claims against government corporations; and it is well settled that the incorporation of the terms of a statute by reference does not incorporate subsequent amendments of that statute.
See Kendall v. United States , 12 Pet.
524, 625 , 9 L.Ed. 1181 ; In re Heath , 144 U.S. 92 , 12 S.Ct. 615 , 36 L.Ed. 358 ; Hassett v. Welch , 303 U.S. 303, 314 , 58 S.Ct. 559 , 82 L.Ed. 858 .
This has been held expressly with respect to the incorporation by R.S.
3490 of the provisions of R.S.
5438 .

In the case cited, the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, speaking through Judge Augustus N. Hand, said: section 5438 section 3490 18 U.S.C.A. 80 section 3490 Kendall v. United States 12 Pet.

The question, then, is narrowed to this: Is a claim against a government corporation, which acts as an agency of the government, a claim against the government of the United States or a department or officer thereof as required by R.S.
5438 as a condition of liability at the time of the adoption of R.S.
3490?
The answer is manifestly that it is not such a claim.
A government corporation, even though acting as an agency of the government is not the government, nor is it a department or officer of the government.
As said by Judge Patterson in United States ex rel.
Salzman v. Salant & Salant , D.C., 41 F.Supp.
196, 197 : "a corporation which is an agency of the government is not the government or a department or officer of it".
See also Pierce v. United States , 314 U.S. 306 , 62 S.Ct. 237 , 86 L.Ed. 226 and Lindgren v. United States Shipping Board Merchant Fleet Corporation , 4 Cir., 55 F.2d 117, 120 , certiorari denied 286 U.S. 542 , 52 S.Ct. 499 , 76 L.Ed. 1280 .
In the case last cited this court said: Sloan Shipyards Corp. v. U. S. Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation 258 U.S. 549, 568 42 S.Ct. 386 66 L.Ed. 762 U[nited] S[tates] Shipping Board Merchant Fleet Corporation v. Harwood 281 U.S. 519, 526 50 S.Ct. 372 74 L.Ed. 1011 There is nothing to the contrary in United States ex rel.
Marcus v. Hess , 317 U.S. 537 , 63 S.Ct. 379, 384 , 87 L.Ed. 443 .
The fraud there was perpetrated not against a government corporation but against the government itself, the decision being that R.S.
5438 covered the case of one who knowingly caused the government to pay claims grounded in fraud.
The gist of the decision is contained in the following quotation, viz.
: Payment was then made from a joint construction bank account containing both federal and local funds The government's money the government to pay The fact that the government corporations here involved were not in existence at the time of the enactment of R.S.
5438 would not be controlling if the language of the section were broad enough to encompass claims against such corporations; but, as we have seen, the language is not broad enough to cover such claims, however liberal an interpretation be placed upon it.
And in this connection we are bound to give consideration to the fact that the language of R.S.
3490 was not amended to cover such claims when amendments were made in the language of R.S.
5438 to cover the making of fraudulent claims against government corporations.
Not only is this true, but it is true also that, in subsequent legislation passed to protect government corporations against false and fraudulent claims, criminal penalties were specifically provided but no provision was made for civil penalties or forfeitures.
See 18 U.S.C. 1010 and 1014.
If it were the intent of Congress that presentation of false claims against such corporations be redressed by actions for civil penalties or forfeitures, it would have been easy enough to have so provided when the statutes were enacted providing the criminal penalties.
Such action by Congress would certainly be more logical and seemly than for the courts to give a forced interpretation to a statute passed three quarters of a century ago when government corporations had not been dreamed of.
Another ground for holding the statute not applicable in case No. 7224 is that the obtaining of the guaranty of loan was not the making of a claim within the meaning of the statute.
United States v. Tieger , 3 Cir., 234 F.2d 589 , certiorari denied 352 U.S. 941 , 77 S.Ct. 262 , 1 L.Ed.2d 237 ; United States v. Cochran , 5 Cir., 235 F.2d 131 , certiorari denied 352 U.S. 941 , 77 S.Ct. 262 , 1 L.Ed.2d 237 .
For the reasons stated, the decision in No. 7224 will be affirmed, the decision in No. 7321 will be reversed in so far as it gives judgment against defendants and affirmed in so far as it denies recovery of damages under the statute, and the decision in No. 7333 will be reversed in so far as it gives judgment against defendants.
