 PER CURIAM.
The question involved in this case is whether a copending patent is part of [**262] the "prior art" within the meaning of that term as used in 35 U.S.C. 103 , and whether a copending patent is a bar to a patent application only if it actually describes the invention for which patent is sought.
Having been unsuccessful in the Patent Office in their application for patent, appellants [plaintiffs] filed suit in the District Court to obtain a judgment authorizing appellee [defendant], Commissioner of Patents, to issue the patent applied for by them.
The District Court, after a full hearing, rendered an opinion finding for appellee and against appellants, and dismissing the complaint.
