 PER CURIAM.
The only question upon this appeal of enough importance to demand notice is the judge's charge, which followed the interpretation put upon 145(b) , 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.
Code, in O'Brien v. United States , 7 Cir., 51 F.2d 193 , which we followed in United States v. Miro , 60 F.2d 58 .
We all agree that we must continue so to construe the section until the Supreme Court decides otherwise; but Judge L. HAND wishes it to appear that as a new matter he would decide otherwise, and would reverse this conviction in accordance with the reasoning of Judge Alschuler's dissent in O'Brien v. United States , supra , which appears to him unanswerable.
Conviction affirmed.
